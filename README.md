# Website

This website is built using [Docusaurus 2](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

## Local Development

```console
npm run start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

## Build

```console
yarn build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.
