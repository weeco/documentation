title: rpk plugin list
rpk_version: v23.1.6 (rev cc47e1ad1)
---

List all available plugins.

By default, this command fetches the remote manifest and prints plugins
available for download. Any plugin that is already downloaded is prefixed with
an asterisk. If a locally installed plugin has a different sha256sum as the one
specified in the manifest, or if the sha256sum could not be calculated for the
local plugin, an additional message is printed.

You can specify --local to print all locally installed plugins, as well as
whether you have "shadowed" plugins (the same plugin specified multiple times).

## Usage

```bash
rpk plugin list [flags]
```
