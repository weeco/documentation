Modify a group's current offsets.

This command allows you to modify a group's offsets. Sometimes, you may need to
rewind a group if you had a mistaken deploy, or fast-forward a group if it is
falling behind on messages that can be skipped.

The --to option allows you to seek to the start of partitions, end of
partitions, or after a specific timestamp. The default is to seek any topic
previously committed. Using --topics allows to you set commits for only the
specified topics; all other commits will remain untouched. Topics with no
commits will not be committed unless allowed with --allow-new-topics.

The --to-group option allows you to seek to commits that are in another group.
This is a merging operation: if g1 is consuming topics A and B, and g2 is
consuming only topic B, "rpk group seek g1 --to-group g2" will update g1's
commits for topic B only. The --topics flag can be used to further narrow which
topics are updated. Unlike --to, all non-filtered topics are committed, even
topics not yet being consumed, meaning --allow-new-topics is not needed.

The --to-file option allows to seek to offsets specified in a text file with
the following format:
[TOPIC] [PARTITION] [OFFSET]
[TOPIC] [PARTITION] [OFFSET]
...
Each line contains the topic, the partition, and the offset to seek to. As with
the prior options, --topics allows filtering which topics are updated. Similar
to --to-group, all non-filtered topics are committed, even topics not yet being
consumed, meaning --allow-new-topics is not needed.

The --to, --to-group, and --to-file options are mutually exclusive. If you are
not authorized to describe or read some topics used in a group, you will not be
able to modify offsets for those topics.

EXAMPLES

Seek group G to June 1st, 2021:
rpk group seek g --to 1622505600
or, rpk group seek g --to 1622505600000
or, rpk group seek g --to 1622505600000000000
Seek group X to the commits of group Y topic foo:
rpk group seek X --to-group Y --topics foo
Seek group G's topics foo, bar, and biz to the end:
rpk group seek G --to end --topics foo,bar,biz
Seek group G to the beginning of a topic it was not previously consuming:
rpk group seek G --to start --topics foo --allow-new-topics

## Usage

```bash
rpk group seek [GROUP] --to (start|end|timestamp) --to-group ... --topics ... [flags]
```
