Manage a Redpanda cloud BYOC agent

For BYOC, Redpanda installs an agent service in your owned cluster. The agent
then proceeds to provision further infrastructure and eventually, a full
Redpanda cluster.

The BYOC command runs Terraform to create and start the agent. You first need
a redpanda-id (or cluster ID); this is used to get the details of how your
agent should be provisioned. You can create a BYOC cluster in our cloud UI
and then come back to this command to complete the process.

## Usage

```bash
rpk cloud byoc [flags]
  rpk cloud byoc [command]
```

## Flags
