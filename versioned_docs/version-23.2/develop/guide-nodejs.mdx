If you haven't already, install Node by [following the appropriate steps for
your OS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/).

Redpanda is Kafka API-compatible, which means
that you can leverage the countless client
libraries created for Kafka (if you find something that is not supported,
reach out to the Redpanda team on our <a href="https://redpanda.com/slack">Slack</a>).
In this example you will use [kafkajs](https://kafka.js.org/).

```bash
# Create and enter the project folder
mkdir redpanda-node
cd redpanda-node
# Generate package.json (use the default values)
npm init
# Install required dependencies
npm i -D typescript
npm i -D @types/node
npm i kafkajs
npm i uuid
npm i -D @types/uuid
# Generate tsconfig.json
tsc --init
```

## Set up a Redpanda environment

Follow the [Redpanda Quickstart](../../get-started/quick-start) to spin up a development
environment in Docker.

:::caution
If you're running Redpanda on your laptop, or in a shared development
environment, then avoid Redpanda's optimized production settings. Running
`sudo rpk redpanda tune all` or manually configuring Redpanda for production
might affect your experience with other applications running on your machine.

## Create a topic

The easiest way to create topics is using
[rpk](../../reference/rpk):

```bash
$ rpk topic create chat-room
TOPIC      STATUS
chat-room  OK
```

The preceding command created a topic named `chat-room`, with the default number of
partitions and replicas. You can list all created topics with:
```bash
$ rpk topic list
NAME       PARTITIONS  REPLICAS
chat-room  1           1
```

You can create topics programmatically too:

```javascript title="src/admin.ts"
import {Kafka} from "kafkajs"

const redpanda = new Kafka({
  brokers: ["localhost:9092"]
})
const admin = redpanda.admin()

export function createTopic(topic: string, partitions?: number, replicas?: number) {
  return admin.connect().then(() => {
    admin.createTopics({
      topics: [{
        topic: topic,
        numPartitions: partitions ? partitions : 1,
        replicationFactor: replicas ? replicas : 1,
      }]
    }).then(() => admin.disconnect())
  })
}
```

After you have a cluster up and running, and a topic to store your data, you can 
build a producer and consumer:

## Producer code

```javascript title="src/producer.ts"
import {Kafka} from "kafkajs"

const redpanda = new Kafka({
  brokers: ["localhost:9092"]
})
const producer = redpanda.producer()

export function getConnection(user: string) {
  return producer.connect().then(() => {
    return (message: string) => {
      return producer.send({
        topic: "chat-room",
        messages: [{value: JSON.stringify({message, user})},],
      })
    }
  })
}

export function disconnect() {
  return producer.disconnect()
}
```

You now have a working producer that sends strings entered by the user to the 
`chat-room` topic. Messages are sent as JSON encoded strings here,
but keep in mind that the producer only sends buffers, so you can encode the
messages however you like.

## Consumer code

```javascript title="src/consumer.ts"
import {Kafka} from "kafkajs"
import {v4 as uuidv4} from "uuid"

const redpanda = new Kafka({
  brokers: ["localhost:9092"]
})
const consumer = redpanda.consumer({groupId: uuidv4()})

export function connect() {
  return consumer.connect().then(() =>
    consumer.subscribe({topic: "chat-room"}).then(() =>
      consumer.run({
        eachMessage: async ({topic, partition, message}) => {
          const formattedValue = JSON.parse((message.value as Buffer).toString())
          console.log(`${formattedValue.user}: ${formattedValue.message}`)
        },
      })
    )
  )
}

export function disconnect() {
  consumer.disconnect()
}
```

You now have a consumer that will read all messages from the `chat-room`
topic and print them to the console. You can start as many consumer groups as
you like, but bear in mind that each group will read a message only once, which is
why the example is using a generated UUID for the group ID.

The following example brings all the preceding examples together: 

```javascript title="src/index.ts"
import * as readline from "node:readline"
import * as Admin from "./admin"
import * as Producer from "./producer"
import * as Consumer from "./consumer"

const rl = readline.createInterface({
  input: process.stdin,
  output: process.stdout
})

function start() {
  const topic = "chat-room"
  console.log(`Creating topic: ${topic}`)
  Admin.createTopic(topic).then(() => {
    console.log("Connecting...")
    Consumer.connect().then(() => {
      rl.question("Enter user name: \n", function (username) {
        Producer.getConnection(username).then((sendMessage) => {
          console.log("Connected, press Ctrl+C to exit")
          rl.on("line", (input) => {
            readline.moveCursor(process.stdout, 0, -1)
            sendMessage(input);
          })
        })
      })
    })
  })  
}
start()

process.on("SIGINT", process.exit)
process.on("exit", () => {
  Producer.disconnect();
  Consumer.disconnect();
  rl.close();
})
``` 

## Running

```bash
tsc src/index.js && node src/index.js
```

Run this at least twice so that you can chat between two terminals, but you can
run as many as you like.

## Wrapping up

Now you have the basic building blocks for working with Redpanda using Node.js.
