You can only run Redpanda directly on Linux. However, you can run Redpanda on macOS in a Docker container. This guide helps you get started with Redpanda for development and testing on macOS.

For production or benchmarking, see [Deploying for Production](../../deployment/production-deployment).

## Get Redpanda running

To run Redpanda on MacOS, use `rpk` to bring up Redpanda nodes in Docker containers.
Make sure that you install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/) first.

To customize the containers, you can also set up your own [Redpanda containers in Docker](../../quickstart/quick-start-docker).

### Install `rpk`

You can install `rpk` on MacOS either with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/), or you can just download the binary.

- To install `rpk` with Homebrew: `brew install redpanda-data/tap/redpanda`
- To download the `rpk` binary:

    1. Download the [rpk archive](https://github.com/redpanda-data/redpanda/releases/latest/download/rpk-darwin-amd64.zip) with `curl -LO https://github.com/redpanda-data/redpanda/releases/latest/download/rpk-darwin-amd64.zip`.
    2. Unpack the archive to `/usr/local/bin` or any location in your `$PATH` with `unzip rpk-darwin-amd64.zip`.

### Run a Redpanda cluster

Run Redpanda in a three-node cluster: 

`rpk container start -n 3`

The first time you run `rpk container start`, it downloads an image matching the rpk version (you can check it by running `rpk version`).
You now have a three-node cluster running Redpanda.

The command output shows the addresses of the cluster nodes:

```bash
$ rpk container start -n 3
Downloading latest version of Redpanda
Starting cluster
Waiting for the cluster to be ready...
  NODE ID  ADDRESS          
  0        127.0.0.1:49462  
  1        127.0.0.1:49468  
  2        127.0.0.1:49467  
```

You can run `rpk` commands to interact with the cluster; for example:

```bash
rpk cluster info --brokers 127.0.0.1:49462,127.0.0.1:49468,127.0.0.1:49467
```

## Delete the nodes

When you're finished with the cluster, shut down and delete the nodes:

```bash
rpk container purge
```
