Redpanda Keeper (rpk) is a single binary application that provides a way to interact with your Redpanda clusters from the command line. 

You can install `rpk` as part of a bundle that includes `redpanda` (see the [Install Redpanda](../) for instructions), or you can install the `rpk` binary separately. 

If you are preparing to deploy a BYOC cluster using the Redpanda Cloud UI, for example, you only need to install the `rpk` binary.

:::note
For a list of all `rpk` commands and their syntax, refer to [rpk documentation](../../reference/rpk).
:::

To install the rpk binary as a standalone application, follow the instructions for your operating system.
