This section describes how to set up a production cluster of Redpanda.

To try out Redpanda, see the [Install Redpanda guides](../../quickstart).

:::note
Before you set up your Redpanda cluster, see [Manage Disk Space](../../deployment/disk-utilization) for guidelines on cluster creation.

## Prepare infrastructure

For best performance, provision hardware according to these requirements:

- XFS for the data directory of Redpanda (`/var/lib/redpanda/data`)
- A kernel that is at least 3.10.0-514, 4.18 or newer is preferred
- Local NVMe, RAID-0 when using multiple disks
- 2GB of memory per core
- TCP ports:
  - `33145` - internal RPC port
  - `9092` - Kafka API port
  - `8082` - HTTP Proxy port
  - `8081` - Schema Registry port
  - `9644` - Prometheus and HTTP admin port

You can use [Terraform to deploy Redpanda](../../deployment/production-deployment-automation).

## Install Redpanda

After the hardware is provisioned, install Redpanda and configure it for production use.

You can also install Redpanda using an [Ansible playbook](../../deployment/production-deployment-automation).

### Install the binary

Install the binary on either Fedora/RedHat or Debian systems.

  <TabItem value="fedora" label="Fedora/RedHat" default>

```bash
curl -1sLf 'https://dl.redpanda.com/nzc4ZYQK3WRGd9sy/redpanda/cfg/setup/bash.rpm.sh' | \
sudo -E bash && sudo yum install redpanda -y
```


  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="debian" label="Debian">

```bash
curl -1sLf 'https://dl.redpanda.com/nzc4ZYQK3WRGd9sy/redpanda/cfg/setup/bash.deb.sh' | \
sudo -E bash && sudo apt install redpanda -y
```


  </TabItem>

</Tabs>


### Set Redpanda production mode

By default, Redpanda is installed in development mode, which turns off hardware optimization.

To enable hardware optimization, set Redpanda to run in production mode:

```bash
sudo rpk redpanda mode production
```

To tune the hardware, on each node:

```bash
sudo rpk redpanda tune all
```

:::note Optional: Benchmark your SSD

On taller machines, Redpanda recommends benchmarking your SSD. This can be done
with `rpk iotune`. You only need to run this once. For reference, a local NVMe SSD should yield around 1GB/s sustained writes.
`rpk iotune` captures SSD wear and tear and gives accurate measurements
of what your hardware is capable of delivering. Run this before benchmarking.

If you're on AWS, GCP, or Azure, creating a new instance and upgrading to
an image with a recent Linux kernel version is often the easiest way to
work around bad devices.

```bash
sudo rpk iotune # takes 10mins
```

:::

### Configure and start the root node

After the software is installed, you must configure it. The first step is
to set up the root node. The root node starts as a standalone node, and
every other one joins it, forming a cluster along the way.

For the root node, choose 0 as its ID. The `--self` option tells the node which interface address to bind to. Usually you want that to be its private IP.

```bash
sudo rpk config bootstrap --id 0 --self <ip> && \
sudo systemctl start redpanda-tuner redpanda
```

If clients will connect from a different subnet, see [Configuring Listeners](../../cluster-administration/listener-configuration).

### Configure and start other nodes

For every other node, you have to choose a unique integer ID for it, and let
it know where to reach the root node.

```bash
sudo rpk config bootstrap --id <unique id> \
--self <private ip>                        \
--ips <root node ip> &&                    \
sudo systemctl start redpanda-tuner redpanda
```

### Verify the installation

To verify that the cluster is up and running, check the logs:

```bash
journalctl -u redpanda
```

To create a topic:

```bash
rpk topic create panda
```
