The Amazon S3 Sink connector stores Apache Kafka messages in an AWS S3 bucket.

## Prerequisites

Before you can create an S3 sink connector in the Redpanda Cloud, you must complete these tasks:

* In the AWS management console, create an S3 bucket associated with your AWS account ID.
* In the IAM console, create an IAM policy to govern access to the bucket. For the minimum list of required permissions, see the sample IAM policy below.
* In the Redpanda Console, [create a topic](../../create-topic).

### Sample IAM policy

The S3 sink connector that accesses the S3 bucket must have certain permissions, which are specified in an IAM policy. When you create a policy in the IAM console, you can copy and paste this text into the policy document section. Remember to replace `bucket-name` with the actual name of your S3 bucket.

{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "s3:PutObject",
                "s3:GetObject",
                "s3:AbortMultipartUpload",
                "s3:ListMultipartUploadParts",
                "s3:ListBucketMultipartUploads"
            ],
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::bucket-name/*"
        }
    ]
}
```

## Create an S3 sink connector

To create an S3 sink connector, first choose the connector type, then configure connector properties, and finally, review and apply the connector configuration. To test the connection, produce a message to the topic and verify that the S3 bucket contains the message.

### Choose connector type

To start configuring an S3 sink connector, choose `S3SinkConnector` as the **Connector Type**.

1. From the navigation menu of the **Cluster** page, select **Kafka Connect**.
2. Click **Create Connector**.
3. In **Installation Target**, select **redpanda connect**.
4. Under **Connector Type**, select **S3SinkConnector** and click **Next**.

The next step is to configure connector properties.

### Configure connector properties

Specify connector properties and list the topics you want to export to the S3 bucket.

1. In **Connector name**, enter a name for your connector.

    As a suggestion, use a name that indicates which S3 bucket the connector is sending data to.
2. In **Key converter class**, select a converter. Choices include:
    * `org.apache.kafka.connect.storage.StringConverter`
    * `org.apache.kafka.connect.json.JsonConverter`
    * `org.apache.kafka.connect.converters.ByteArrayConverter`
    * `io.confluent.connect.avro.AvroConverter`

    :::note

    The following converters are not supported:
    * `io.confluent.connect.protobuf.ProtobufConverter`
    * `io.confluent.connect.json.JsonSchemaConverter`

    :::

3. In **Topics**, enter the name of the topic whose records will be exported to the S3 bucket. If more than one topic will be exported, provide a comma-separated list; for example, `topic1, topic2, topic3`.

    As an alternative, you can enter a regular expression in **Topics regex** to specify the topics you want to export.
4. In **Value converter class**, select a converter. The choices are the same as for the **Key converter class**.
5. Click **AWS** and fill in the following information (available from the AWS management console):
    * `aws.access.key.id`
    * `aws.secret.access.key`
    * `aws.s3.bucket.name`
    * `aws.s3.region`
6. Click **File** and fill in the following information:
    * `file.name.prefix` (optional)
    * `file.name.template` (optional)
    * `file.compression.type` (default is `none`)
    * `file.max.records` (default is 0)
    * `file.name.timestamp.timezone`
    * `file.name.timestamp.source` (default is `WALLCLOCK`)
7. Click **Format** and fill in the following fields:
    * `format.output.type` (choices include `csv`, `json`, `jsonl`, and `parquet`)
    * `format.output.fields` (default is `value`)
    * `format.output.fields.value.encoding` (default is `base64`)
8. Click **Next Step**.

    The **Review** page opens.

### Review connector configuration

Check that the **Connector Plugin** is correct and that the information in **Connector Properties** is correct.

1. Verify that the **Connector Properties** file contains all the values you set on the **S3SinkConnector** page.
2. Manually edit the file and add the following line:
    `"value.converter.schemas.enable": "false"`

    Remember to add a comma at the end of the previous line.
3. Click **Finish**.

    The **connectors** summary page opens.

## Test the connection

After the connector is created, test the connection by writing to one of your topics, then checking the contents of the S3 bucket in the AWS management console.

1. From the navigation menu, select **Topics**.
2. On the **Topics** page, click the name of the topic you created for exporting to your S3 bucket.

    The summary page for that topic opens.
3. Open the **Actions** menu and select **Publish Message**.

    The **Produce Message** dialog box opens.
4. Select the **Key** tab and type a key on the first line.

    For example, type `key-1`.
5. Select the **Value** tab and type a value on the first line.

    For example, type `[{"name":"user-1"}]`.
6. Click **Publish**.
7. Click **Close** to close the success message.
8. From the navigation menu, select **Kafka Connect**.
9. Under **Cluster**, click the cluster name.

    The cluster summary page opens, and the state for **Connector** shows `Running`.
10. In the AWS management console, display the page for your S3 bucket.
11. Click the refresh symbol to refresh the page, then verify that your S3 bucket is listed.
12. Click your S3 bucket name to see the topic.
