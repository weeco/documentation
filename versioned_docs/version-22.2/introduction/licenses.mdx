## Redpanda Community Edition

Redpanda Community Edition is licensed with the Redpanda [Business Source License (BSL)](https://github.com/redpanda-data/redpanda/blob/dev/licenses/bsl.md). These core features are free and source-available. 

:::note

* The BSL code converts to Apache 2.0 licensing four years after each code merge.

## Redpanda Enterprise Edition

Redpanda Enterprise Edition is licensed with the [Redpanda Community License (RCL)](https://github.com/redpanda-data/redpanda/blob/dev/licenses/rcl.md). It includes the free features licensed under the Redpanda BSL, as well as the following features:

* [Tiered Storage](../../data-management/tiered-storage)
* [Data Archiving](../../data-management/data-archiving)
* [Continuous Data Balancing](../../cluster-administration/continuous-data-balancing)
* [Remote Read Replica](../../data-management/remote-read-replicas)
* [Redpanda Console single sign-on authentication](../../console/single-sign-on/authentication)
* [Redpanda Console role-based access control](../../console/single-sign-on/authorization)

Enterprise features require a license key. You can evaluate enterprise features with a free 30-day trial. Contact [Redpanda Sales](https://redpanda.com/try-redpanda?section=enterprise-trial) to request a trial license, to extend your trial period, or to purchase an Enterprise Edition license.

### Apply license key

A license key unlocks Redpanda Enterprise Edition features. To apply the license key to your cluster, run:

`rpk cluster license set` 

Either provide a path to a file containing the license, or provide the license string inline. For example, run:

`rpk cluster license set --path /home/organization/redpanda.license --api-urls 0.0.0.0:9645`

or 

`rpk cluster license set <license string>`

If neither the path or the license string are are provided, `rpk` looks for the license in `/etc/redpanda/redpanda.license`. 

### Check license status

To check the status of your current license, run:

`rpk cluster license info --api-urls 0.0.0.0:9645`

Redpanda sends warning messages in the cluster logs if you enable enterprise features without a valid license key.
