As part of Redpanda's evolution, new versions are released over time to deliver new features, enhancements, and improvements.
Due to that, it's essential to keep Redpanda up to date. This guide details how to upgrade versions relevant to the environment that Redpanda is currently running in.

:::info
Before upgrading to alternate versions, refer to the [release notes](https://github.com/redpanda-data/redpanda/releases) to learn about any breaking changes.
:::

## Checking the current version

Before changing to a different version, you will first need to determine which version is currently running in your environment.
To determine the current version, run the following commands:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="check-linux" label="Linux" default>

```bash
curl -s -XGET http://<broker host>:9644/v1/brokers/
```

:::note
The command returns all broker information at once.

Remember to replace the variable `<broker host>`.
:::

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="check-macos" label="MacOS" default>

```bash
brew list --versions | grep redpanda
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="check-kubernetes" label="Kubernetes" default>

```bash
kubectl exec -it -n <cluster_name> <pod-name> -- rpk version
```

:::note
Remember to replace the variables `<cluster_name>` and `<pod_name>`.
:::

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="check-docker" label="Docker" default>

:::caution
Running Redpanda directly via Docker is not supported for production usage. This platform should only be used for testing.
:::

```bash
docker exec -it <container_name> rpk version 
```

:::note
Remember to replace the variable `<container_name>`.
:::

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

The expected output looks similar to:

```bash
v21.11.5 (rev af88fa1)
```

## Available versions
You can check which versions are available in the [release notes](https://github.com/redpanda-data/redpanda/releases).

## Upgrading your version

:::note
When upgrading between major versions, Redpanda only supports upgrading one version at a time. For example, upgrading from `22.1` to `22.2` is supported, while upgrading from `22.1` directly to `22.3` is not. In the latter case, you would upgrade first to `22.2`, and then to `22.3`.
:::

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="upgrade-linux" label="Linux" default>

For Linux distributions, the process changes according to the distribution:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="fedora-redhat" label="Fedora/RedHat" default>

Execute the following commands on the terminal:
```bash
sudo yum update redpanda
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="debian-ubuntu" label="Debian/Ubuntu">

Execute the following commands on the terminal:
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install redpanda
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>


</TabItem>
<TabItem value="upgrade-macos" label="MacOS" default>

If you have previously installed Redpanda with brew, you can run the following command:

```bash
brew install vectorizedio/tap/redpanda
```

Installations from binary files require you to download the preferred version from the release list and then to overwrite the current rpk file in the installed location.

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="upgrade-kubernetes" label="Kubernetes" default>

:::caution
To prevent any potential data loss when Kubernetes is locally executed, you must use persistent volumes.
:::

All applications running in Kubernetes require deployment files to execute, including Redpanda.
To upgrade to the latest version, change the `version` tag in your deployment file:

```yaml
...
spec:
  image: "vectorized/redpanda"
  version: "<current_version>"
...
```

After saving the file, you will need to apply the changes with the following command:

```bash
kubectl apply -f <file_path/file_name>
```

Once the changes are applied, the cluster will perform a rolling upgrade, restarting one pod at a time. During the upgrade, the status field `upgrading` is _true_. You will be able to see the status of the cluster by running the following command:

```bash
kubectl describe cluster <cluster_name>
```

The `upgrading` status will show as _false_ once the upgrade is complete.

To validate the individual pod details, and the image tag (version), use the following command:

```bash
kubectl describe pod <pod_name>
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="upgrade-docker" label="Docker" default>

:::caution
Running Redpanda directly via Docker is not supported for production usage. This platform should only be used for testing.
:::

To perform an upgrade you must replace the current image with a new one.

First, check which image is currently running on your Docker:

```bash
docker ps
```

:::caution
To prevent any potential data loss when Docker is locally executed, you must use persistent volumes. For more information, refer to [persistent volumes](../../quickstart/quick-start-docker#create-network-and-persistent-volumes).
:::

Stop and remove Redpanda's container(s):

```bash
docker stop <container_id>
...
docker rm <container_id>
```

Remove current images:

```bash
docker rmi <image_id>
```

Pull the desired Redpanda's version, or adjust the setting to `latest` in the `version` tag:

```bash
docker pull docker.redpanda.com/redpandadata/redpanda:<version>
```

If you have any questions about how to start Redpanda on Docker, refer to [docker getting started](../../quickstart/quick-start-docker).

Once completed, restart the cluster:

```bash
docker restart <container_name>
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

## Post-upgrade applications

Now, you will have the desired version of Redpanda running.

Once the upgrade is complete, you will need to ensure that the cluster is healthy.
To verify that the cluster is running properly, run the following command:

```bash
rpk cluster health
```

If you want to view additional information about your brokers, run:

```bash
rpk redpanda admin brokers list
```

You'll also want to set up a real-time dashboard to monitor your cluster health. That can be  done by following the steps in our [monitoring guide](../../cluster-administration/monitoring).

If you would like to perform a rolling upgrade on your cluster using maintenance mode, refer to [Node Maintenance Mode](../../cluster-administration/node-management). Keep in mind that rolling upgrades are only available in versions **22.1 and later**.
