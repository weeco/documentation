Before you can start streaming with Redpanda, install the software.

- To install Redpanda on a one-node cluster for development and testing purposes, see the [installation instructions](../) for your operating system.
- To install Redpanda on a production cluster, see [Deploying Redpanda for Production](../../deployment/production-deployment).

## Streaming with rpk

`rpk` is a CLI tool you can use to work with your Redpanda nodes. Refer to [rpk Commands](../../reference/rpk/rpk-topic) for more information about `rpk`.

Here are some sample commands to produce and consume streams:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="docker" label="Docker" default>

Create a topic called `twitch_chat`:

```bash
docker exec -it redpanda-1 \
rpk topic create twitch_chat --brokers=localhost:9092
```

Output:

```text
TOPIC       STATUS
twitch_chat  OK
```

Produce a message into the topic:

```bash
docker exec -it redpanda-1 \
rpk topic produce twitch_chat --brokers=localhost:9092
```

Enter a message:

```text
Pandas are fabulous!
```

Output:

```text
Produced to partition 0 at offset 0 with timestamp 1663282629789.
```

Click `ctrl-d` (or `ctrl-z` on Windows) to finish sending messages to the topic.

Consume one message from the topic:

```bash
docker exec -it redpanda-1 \
rpk topic consume twitch_chat --num 1 --brokers=localhost:9092
```

Each message is shown with its metadata, like this:

```json
{
  "topic": "twitch_chat",
  "value": "Pandas are fabulous!",
  "timestamp": 1663282629789,
  "partition": 0,
  "offset": 0
}
```

You can delete your topic by running:

```bash
docker exec -it redpanda-1 \
rpk topic delete twitch_chat --brokers=localhost:9092
```

Output:

```text
TOPIC       STATUS
twitch_chat  OK
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="linux" label="Linux" default>

Create a topic called `twitch_chat`:

```bash
rpk topic create twitch_chat
```

Output:

```text
TOPIC       STATUS
twitch_chat  OK
```

Produce a message into the topic:

```bash
rpk topic produce twitch_chat
```

Enter a message:

```text
Pandas are fabulous!
```

Output:

```text
Produced to partition 0 at offset 0 with timestamp 1663282629795.
```

Click `ctrl-d` (or `ctrl-z` on Windows) to finish sending messages to the topic.

Consume one message from the topic:

```bash

```

Each message is shown with its metadata, like this:

```json

  "timestamp": 1663282629795,
  "partition": 0,
  "offset": 0
}
```

You can delete your topic by running:

```bash

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="kubernetes" label="Kubernetes" default>
Set up an alias to simplify these commands:

```bash
alias rpk="kubectl -n redpanda exec -ti redpanda-0 -c redpanda -- rpk --brokers=redpanda-0.redpanda.redpanda.svc.cluster.local.:9093"
```

Create a topic called `twitch_chat`:

```bash
rpk topic create twitch_chat
```

Output:

```text
TOPIC       STATUS
twitch_chat  OK
```

Describe the topic:

```bash
rpk topic describe twitch_chat
```

Output:

```text
