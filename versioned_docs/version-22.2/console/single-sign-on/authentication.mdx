Redpanda Console supports authentication via OAuth 2.0 or OIDC for external identity providers, such as:
- [Google](../../single-sign-on/identity-providers/google)
- [GitHub](../../single-sign-on/identity-providers/github)
- [Okta](../../single-sign-on/identity-providers/okta)
- [Generic OIDC](../../single-sign-on/identity-providers/generic-oidc)

You can use one or more login providers at the same time. To enable SSO authentication 
you must create an OAuth application for your organization first. Visit the respective
documentation page for guidance to setup your desired identity provider in Console.
Afterwards you can configure your identity provider in Redpanda Console by providing the
clientId and clientSecret in the configuration block for your provider. The configuration
to add Google login support looks like this:

```yaml
login:
  enabled: true
  # jwtSecret is a secret that is used to sign and encrypt the JSON Web tokens
  # that are used by the backend for session management.
  jwtSecret: abcadsdadasdasdas
  google:
    enabled: true
    clientId: redacted.apps.googleusercontent.com
    clientSecret: redacted # can be set via environment variable
    # The directory config is optional. You have to configure it if you want to use
    # Google groups in your RBAC role bindings.
    # directory:
    #  serviceAccountFilepath: /etc/secrets/google-sa.json
    #  # targetPrincipal is the user that shall be impersonated
    #  # for the Google Admin API calls.
    #  targetPrincipal: admin@mycompany.com
```

By default, users don't have any permissions in Redpanda Console. This also includes permission
to login at all. Thus authentication and authorization must always be used together.
Continue with the authorization configuration by reading the RBAC-based [authorization
concept](../authorization).
