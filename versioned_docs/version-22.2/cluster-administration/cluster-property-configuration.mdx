When you install Redpanda software, it automatically generates a cluster configuration with default settings assigned to each cluster property. 
You might want to change some of the default settings, particularly if you plan to use features such as rack awareness or tiered storage, which are disabled by default.

[Tunable properties](../../reference/tunable-properties), such as internal buffer sizes, have default settings that you typically do not need to modify during normal operations. You should only change these properties after collecting sufficient data to warrant a change. 

To view all cluster properties, along with their descriptions and default settings, refer to [Cluster configuration properties](../../reference/cluster-properties) and [Tunable properties](../../reference/tunable-properties).

## Editing cluster properties

To change any property settings, edit the configuration from the command line using your default text editor. As you make changes, the Redpanda Admin API verifies that the new value is valid. For example, if you change `fetch_max_bytes` from the default of `57671680` to `5o` (using the letter “o” by mistake), the system displays the following message:

```bash
PROPERTY         PRIOR     NEW
fetch_max_bytes  57671680  5o

Validation errors:
 * fetch_max_bytes: expected type integer

No changes were made.
```

The following instructions explain how to change the values currently assigned to cluster properties. After you save your configuration changes, the new values are automatically applied and a new version number is generated. Any subsequent edits start with the most recent version of the configuration.

:::note
Some properties require that you restart the cluster for a change to take effect. When this is the case, the default configuration includes this information in the descriptions for these properties.
:::

To assign new values to cluster properties:

1. Open a terminal window and log in to a node on your cluster.
2. At the prompt, type `rpk cluster config edit`. To edit tuning properties, type `rpk cluster config edit --all` instead.
3. Edit the configuration file and set values for the [properties](../../reference/cluster-properties) you want to change.
4. Save the file and quit the editor.
5. At the prompt, type `rpk cluster config status` to see whether the cluster requires a restart. If a restart is necessary, you will see a message like this:

```bash
$ rpk cluster config status
NODE  CONFIG-VERSION  NEEDS-RESTART  INVALID  UNKNOWN
1     4               true           []       []
```

6. If necessary, restart the cluster.

When you finish your edits, the system updates the configuration and displays a message that lists which property settings were changed, along with their prior and new values. The message also includes the new version number of the configuration. For example:

```bash
PROPERTY             PRIOR  NEW
tx_timeout_delay_ms  1000   2000

Successfully updated configuration. New configuration version is 2.
```

:::note
You can also change property values using the `rpk cluster config set` command, but this method does not display the current setting or the description.
:::

## Viewing the current value of a property

To see the current value of a property, run `rpk cluster config get <property_name>`. For example:

```bash
$ rpk cluster config get log_compression_type
producer
```

## Copying configurations to other clusters

Use the `export` option to save the current cluster configuration to a file. You can then copy this file to other clusters so they can use the same configuration.

1. Export the current configuration settings to a `.yaml` file by running `rpk cluster config export –filename <filename>.yaml`. To store the configuration file outside your current working directory, use the full pathname for `–filename`; otherwise, supply the filename to store the file in your current working directory.
2. Copy `<filename>.yaml` to the other cluster.
3. Log in to the other cluster and import the file with the saved configuration by running `rpk cluster config import –filename <filename>.yaml`. This command applies the property settings in `<filename>.yaml` to all nodes in the cluster.

:::caution
Redpanda does not support importing cluster-specific identification (such as `cluster_id`) with this command.
:::

## Removing cluster properties from a redpanda.yaml file

If you have a `redpanda.yaml` file that contains both cluster and node properties, the cluster properties are ignored.
You can remove cluster properties from the `redpanda.yaml` file by running the following command:

```bash
rpk cluster config lint
```

This avoids the issue of referring to a previous version or custom configuration.
