A Remote Read Replica topic is a read-only topic that mirrors a topic on a different cluster.

When a topic has cloud storage enabled, you can create a separate remote cluster just for consumers of this topic, and populate its topics from cloud storage. A read-only topic on a remote cluster can serve any consumer, without increasing the load on the origin cluster.

You can create Remote Read Replica topics in a Redpanda cluster that directly accesses data stored in cloud object storage. Because these read-only topics access data directly from object storage instead of the topics' origin cluster, there's no impact to the performance of the cluster. Furthermore, topic data can be consumed within a region of your choice, regardless of the region where it was produced. If you plan to create a Remote Read Replica topic in another region, consider using a [multi-region bucket](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/features/multi-region-access-points/) to simplify deployment and optimize performance. Sample use cases for Remote Read Replicas include data analytics, offline model training, and development clusters.

## Creating a topic with archival storage or Tiered Storage

Before you can create a Remote Read Replica, you must create a topic on the origin cluster, and set up an S3 bucket for the topic's cloud storage. Remote Read Replicas work with both archival storage and [Tiered Storage](../../data-management/tiered-storage/).

1. Create an S3 bucket to store the original data.
2. Create the original topic by running `rpk topic create <topic_name>`, and specifying the number of partitions and the number of replicas.
3. Enable cloud storage on the origin cluster by running `rpk cluster config edit`, and then specify the following cluster configuration properties:

    | Property | Description |
    | :------  | :---------  |
    | `cloud_storage_enabled: true` | Must be set to `true` to enable the cloud storage feature. |
    | `cloud_storage_bucket: “<bucket_name>”` | The S3 bucket where the original data is stored. |
    | `cloud_storage_access_key: “<access_key>”` | The access key used for authentication. When using [IAM roles](../../security/iam-roles), you do not have to specify this property. |
    | `cloud_storage_secret_key: “<secret_key>”` | The secret key used for authentication.  When using IAM roles, you do not have to specify this property. |
    | `cloud_storage_region: “<region>”` | The region where the S3 bucket is located. This must be a supported region. |
    | `cloud_storage_enable_remote_write` | When using archival storage or Tiered Storage on the origin cluster, set to `true` to enable data to be uploaded from Redpanda and written to cloud storage for all topics. To only enable data upload for a specific topic, set `cloud_storage_enable_remote_write: false` and run `rpk topic create <topic_name> -c redpanda.remote.write=true` when you create the topic. |
    | `cloud_storage_enable_remote_read` | When using Tiered Storage on the origin cluster, set to `true` to enable consumers to read from all topics in cloud storage. To enable consumers to only read from one topic, set `cloud_storage_enable_remote_read: false` and run `rpk topic create <topic_name> -c redpanda.remote.read=true` when you create the topic.
4. If you're using Google Cloud Storage, set the `cloud_storage_api_endpoint` property to `storage.googleapis.com`.

## Setting up a Remote Read Replica

To set up a Remote Read Replica topic on a separate remote cluster:

1. Create a remote cluster for the Remote Read Replica topic in the same region as the S3 bucket used for the origin cluster. If the S3 bucket is a multi-region bucket, you can create the read replica cluster in any region that has that bucket. If the S3 bucket is a single-region bucket, the remote cluster must be in the same region as the S3 bucket.
2. Run `rpk cluster config edit`, and then specify the following cluster configuration properties:

    | Property | Description |
    | :------  | :---------  |
    | `cloud_storage_enabled: true` | Must be set to `true` to enable the cloud storage feature. |
    | `cloud_storage_bucket: “none”` | No S3 bucket is needed for the remote cluster. |
    | `cloud_storage_access_key: “<access_key>”` | The access key that allows read access to the S3 bucket. When using [IAM roles](../../security/iam-roles), you do not have to specify this property. |
    | `cloud_storage_secret_key: “<secret_key>”` | The secret key that allows read access to the S3 bucket.  When using IAM roles, you do not have to specify this property. |
    | `cloud_storage_region: “<region>”` | The region where the remote cluster is created. |
4. If you're using Google Cloud Storage, set the `cloud_storage_api_endpoint` property to `storage.googleapis.com`.
3. Create the Remote Read Replica topic by running `rpk topic create <topic_name> -c redpanda.remote.readreplica=<bucket_name>`. For `<topic_name>`, use the same name as the original topic. For `<bucket_name>`, use the S3 bucket specified in the `cloud_storage_bucket` property for the origin cluster.
