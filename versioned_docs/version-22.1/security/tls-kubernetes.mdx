This document provides details on how to enable Transport Layer Security (TLS) on Kubernetes. Alone, TLS authenticates the server and encrypts communication between the client and the server. To add client authentication, you can combine TLS encryption with [SASL authentication](../../security/kubernetes-sasl/)or you can configure [SASL authentication](../../security/kubernetes-sasl/).

For information about Redpanda authentication on Kubernetes in general, see the [Redpanda security on Kubernetes](../../security/kubernetes-security) document. You’ll find information there about supported authentication methods for each API.

Redpanda supports TLS on all four APIs:

* Kafka API
* HTTP Proxy (formerly Pandaproxy)
* Schema registry
* Admin API

The steps in this document show you how to:

1. Create the cluster specification file
2. Optionally, configure external connectivity
3. Optionally, provide an issuer or certificate
4. Create the Redpanda cluster
5. Create the ConfigMap
6. Configure the Pod
7. Create the Pod
8. Connect to Redpanda
9. Clean up

For a quick tutorial, the steps below contain **Tutorial: Stegosaurus** sections that have commands that you can copy and paste to enable TLS. To use the tutorial, just follow the steps below.

## Prerequisites

This guide assumes that you have already completed the following tasks:

1. Configured the kubectl context
2. Installed cert-manager
3. Installed the Redpanda operator

If you haven’t completed these tasks, you can use one of the following quickstarts to get set up before you configure TLS. Just follow the steps in any of these guides and stop before you install and connect to the Redpanda cluster:

* [Kubernetes quickstart for cloud](../../quickstart/kubernetes-qs-cloud)
* [Kubernetes quickstart with local access on kind](../../quickstart/kubernetes-qs-cloud)
* [Kubernetes quickstart with local access on minikube](../../quickstart/kubernetes-qs-cloud)

## **Step 1: Create the cluster specification file**

The Redpanda GitHub repository contains a `tls.yaml` example configuration file that you can use to enable TLS. You can find the file here:

[redpanda-examples../../example-config/kubernetes/tls.yaml](https://github.com/redpanda-data/redpanda-examples/blob/main/docs/example-config/kubernetes/tls.yaml)

:::note
If you want to modify the example file, save it locally and make the required changes listed below. If you’re following along with the stegosaurus tutorial or if you don’t need to make changes to the example file, you don’t need to save the file locally.
:::

The text below is the Redpanda `tls.yaml` file with the relevant sections highlighted:

```yaml
apiVersion: redpanda.vectorized.io/v1alpha1
kind: Cluster
// highlight-start
metadata:
  name: cluster-sample-tls
  // highlight-end
spec:
  image: "vectorized/redpanda"
  version: "latest"
  replicas: 1
  resources:
    requests:
      cpu: 1
      memory: 1.2G
    limits:
      cpu: 1
      memory: 1.2G
  configuration:
    rpcServer:
      port: 33145
      // highlight-start
    kafkaApi:
     - port: 9092
        tls:
          enabled: true
    pandaproxyApi:
     - port: 8082
       tls:
         enabled: true
    schemaRegistry:
       port: 8081
       tls:
         enabled: true
    adminApi:
     - port: 9644
       tls:
         enabled: true
         // highlight-end
    developerMode: true
```

Complete these steps to configure the cluster specification file. The steps reference the highlighted lines in the file above:

1. Save the file locally to make the required changes.
2. Configure the cluster name. The following property in the file above is the name of the cluster. Change this value to the name of your cluster:

```yaml
name: cluster-sample-tls
```

3. Enable TLS for each API individually. You can enable TLS on one or more of the APIs. In the example above, all four API have TLS enabled - Kafka API, HTTP Proxy (`pandaproxyAPI`), Schema Registry, and Admin API:

```yaml
   kafkaApi:
     - port: 9092
        tls:
          enabled: true
    pandaproxyApi:
     - port: 8082
       tls:
         enabled: true
    schemaRegistry:
       port: 8081
       tls:
         enabled: true
    adminApi:
     - port: 9644
       tls:
         enabled: true
```

### Tutorial: Stegosaurus

If you want to follow along with the stegosaurus example, you do not need to do anything for this step. Take note of the contents of the file, but you don’t need to modify it or save it locally.

## Step 2: Optionally, configure external connectivity

You can specify up to two listeners for each API, but only one listener can have TLS enabled. If you do have two listeners, one must be internal and one must be external. The exception is Schema Registry. The Schema Registry listener can be internal, or it can be an internal port that is used internally and externally. If you enable external connectivity on Schema Registry, the Kubernetes node port connects to the internal Redpanda port to provide external connectivity.

To enable external connectivity with TLS, add the following lines to each API in the configuration file that you created in **Step 1**:

```yaml
- external:
    enabled: true
    subdomain: <subdomain_name>
```

The `subdomain` field allows you to specify the advertised address of the external listener. The subdomain addresses, including the brokers, must be registered with a DNS provider, such as [Amazon Route 53](https://aws.amazon.com/route53/). You only need to include the subdomain name in this field, not the brokers. Each API in the configuration file must have the same `subdomain` specified.

The external port is generated automatically and you do not need to specify it. In the example below, TLS is enabled on the external listener for the Kafka API. Enable external connectivity the same way for Admin API and HTTP Proxy.

```yaml
kafkaApi:
 - port: 9092
 - external:
     enabled: true
     subdomain: <subdomain_name>
   tls:
     enabled: true
```

The Schema Registry syntax is slightly different in that the ports are not a list. You can specify one internal port and one external port. Schema Registry always uses an internal port and with external connectivity configured, the Kubernetes node port connects to the internal Redpanda port. Configure TLS with external connectivity for Schema Registry like this:

```yaml
schemaRegistry:
   port: 8081
   external:
     enabled: true
     subdomain: <subdomain_name>
   tls:
     enabled: true
```

For more information about external connectivity, including subdomains, see the [External connectivity](../../security/kubernetes-security#external-connectivity) section of the Redpanda security on Kubernetes documentation.

### Tutorial: Stegosaurus

The stegosaurus tutorial does not use external connectivity, so you do not have to do anything for this step.

## Step 3: Optionally, provide an issuer or certificate

Kafka API and Schema Registry allow you to provide a certificate issuer or certificate.

When you enable TLS, the Redpanda operator generates a root certificate for each API. However, for Kafka API and Schema registry you can instead specify a certificate issuer or a certificate.

For information about how certificates are created and used in Redpanda, see the [Certificates](../../security/kubernetes-security/#certificates) section of the Redpanda security on Kubernetes document.


### Provide an issuer

To provide a certificate issuer, add the `issuerRef` property to the cluster specification file that you created in the previous step. For information about issuers, see the cert-manager [Issuer](https://cert-manager.io/docs/concepts/issuer/) documentation.

You can provide an issuer for `kafkaAPI` or `schemaRegistry` in the same way. The example here is the `kafkaAPI` configuration with the `issuerRef` property highlighted:

```yaml
kafkaApi:
 - port: 9092
   tls:
     enabled: true
     // highlight-start
     issuerRef:
       name: <issuer_name>
       kind: <issuer>
     // highlight-end
```

The `issuerRef` property contains the following variables:

* `issuer_name` - The name of the issuer or cluster issuer.
* `issuer` - A Kubernetes resource that represents a certificate authority. The value of this property can be `Issuer` or `ClusterIssuer`. If the `kind` property is not set, or if it is set to `Issuer`, an issuer with the name specified in the `name` property that exists in the same namespace as the certificate will be used.

### Provide a certificate

You can provide a certificate as a Secret by adding the `nodeSecretRef` property to the cluster specification file that you created above. For information about Secrets, see the Kubernetes [Secrets](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/) documentation. The cert-manager [Certificate](https://cert-manager.io/docs/concepts/certificate/) documentation contains detailed information about certificates, including a diagram of the certificate lifecycle.

You can provide a certificate for `kafkaAPI` or `schemaRegistry` in the same way. The example here is the `kafkaAPI` configuration with the `nodeSecretRef` property highlighted:

```yaml
kafkaApi:
 - port: 9092
   tls:
     enabled: true
     // highlight-start
     nodeSecretRef:
       name: <secret_name>
       namespace: <secret_namespace>
       // highlight-end
```

The `nodeSecretRef` property contains the following variables:

* `secret_name` - Name of the certificate secret.
* `secret_namespace` - The Kubernetes namespace where the certificate secret is. If the secret is in a different namespace than the Redpanda cluster, the operator copies it to the namespace of the Redpanda cluster.


### Tutorial: Stegosaurus

The stegosaurus tutorial uses the certificates generated by cert-manager, so you do not have to do anything for this step.

## Step 4: Create the Redpanda cluster

After you configure the cluster specification file, run the `kubectl apply` command to create the cluster. You can run the command using a path to the cluster specification file on your local machine or you can use the URL to the sample `tls.yaml` file above.

If you modified the file in the previous step, you will have the file saved locally. Run this command to create the Redpanda cluster:

```bash
kubectl apply -f <cluster_specification.yaml>
```

If you did not modify the example file, you can use the URL to the example file in GitHub to create the cluster:

```bash
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/redpanda-data/redpanda-examples/main/docs/example-config/kubernetes/tls.yaml
```

### Tutorial: Stegosaurus

To create the cluster for the stegosaurus tutorial, run this command:

```bash
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/redpanda-data/redpanda-examples/main/docs/example-config/kubernetes/tls.yaml
```

## Step 5: Create the ConfigMap

Create a `yaml` file that will hold the configuration for TLS, including the location of the public certificate. In the next step, you will create the Pod, which will consume this ConfigMap. This will allow you to run `rpk` commands with TLS.

:::info
The Kubernetes [ConfigMaps](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/configmap/) documentation has everything you ever wanted to know about ConfigMaps.
:::

1. Copy the text below and save it locally as a `yaml` file, such as `tls_config_map.yaml`.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: <ConfigMap_name>
data:
  redpanda.yaml: |
    redpanda:
    rpk:
      kafka_api:
      brokers:
        - <cluster_name>-0.<cluster_name>.default.svc.cluster.local:9092
      tls:
        truststore_file: <truststore_file_path>/ca.crt
```

2. In the file that you just saved, configure these variables:
    * `ConfigMap_name` - Name of the ConfigMap. This can be any string. This is what you will use to reference the ConfigMap in the next step when you configure the Pod.
    * `cluster_name` - The name of the Redpanda cluster that you defined in the cluster specification file.
    * `truststore_file_path` - The directory where you want to mount the `ca.crt` file. Generally this is `/etc/tls/certs/ca`.

3. Save the file.

### External connectivity

If you are configuring TLS with external connectivity, you must configure the brokers accordingly. Replace the `brokers` property in the example file with this:

```yaml
brokers:
 - 0.<subdomain_name>.:<node_port>
```

Configure the following variables in the `brokers` property:

* `subdomain_name` - The name of the subdomain that you included in the cluster specification file in **Step 1**.
* `node_port` - The Kafka API external port. Unless you included this in the cluster specification file, this port is autogenerated by Kubernetes.

### Tutorial: Stegosaurus

If you're following along with the stegosaurus tutorial, save the following text locally as a file called `stegosaurus_config.yaml`:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: stegosaurus-config
data:
  redpanda.yaml: |
    redpanda:
    rpk:
      kafka_api:
      brokers:
       - cluster-sample-tls-0.cluster-sample-tls.default.svc.cluster.local:9092
      tls:
        truststore_file: /etc/tls/certs/ca/ca.crt
```

## Step 6: Configure the Pod

The Pod is the process that consumes the ConfigMap that you created in the previous step. This Pod runs the Redpanda image in order to run `rpk`, which is part of the Redpanda image.

:::info
For everything you ever wanted to know about Pods, see the Kubernetes [Pods](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/) documentation.
:::

1. Copy the text below and save it locally as a `yaml` file, such as `tls_pod.yaml`.

```yaml
piVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: <pod_name>
spec:
  containers:
    - name: rpk
      image: 'vectorized/redpanda:<redpanda-version>'
      command:
        - /bin/bash
        - '-c'
      args:
        - sleep infinity
      volumeMounts:
        - mountPath: <truststore_file_path>
          name: <ca_volume_name>
        - mountPath: /etc/redpanda
          name: <rpk_volume_name>
  restartPolicy: Never
  volumes:
    - name: <ca_volume_name>
      secret:
        secretName: <cluster_name>-redpanda
    - name: <rpk_volume_name>
      configMap:
        name: <configMap_name>
```

2. In the file that you just saved, configure these variables:
    * `pod_name` - Name of the Pod. This is the Pod that will run `rpk`. This can be any string.
    * `args` - Specifies what you want the Pod to do. You can execute `rpk` commands here. This example uses the `sleep infinity` argument, which tells the Pod to keep running so that you can execute as many `rpk` commands as you want from the command line.
3. Configure the `volumeMounts` properties. There are two of these; one for `ca`, and one for `rpk`.
    * `ca` - The path and the name of the `ca.crt` volume mount.
        * `truststore_file_path` - The same path that you specified in the `truststore_file_path` property in the ConfigMap. Generally this is `/etc/tls/certs/ca`.
        * `ca_volume_name` - Can be any string, but it must be the same as `ca_volume_name` in the `volume` property of this file.
    * `rpk` - The path and the name of the `rpk` volume mount.
        * `rpk_volume_name` - Can be any string, but it must be the same as `rpk_volume_name` in the `volume` property of this file.
4. Configure the `volume` properties. There are two of these; one for `ca`, and one for `rpk`.
    * `ca` - The name and Secret of the `ca.crt` volume mount.
        * `ca_volume_name` - Must be the same as the `ca_volume_name` in the `volumeMounts` property of this file.
        * `cluster_name` - The cluster name that you defined in the cluster specification file in **Step 1**. The `secretName` property specifies the name of the node Secret. For the Kafka API, this is `<cluster_name>-redpanda`.
    * `rpk` - The volume name and ConfigMap name of the `rpk` volume mount.
        * `rpk_volume_name` - Must match the `<rpk_volume_name>` in the `volumeMounts` property of this file.
        * `configMap_name` - The ConfigMap name that you specified in the `name` property of the ConfigMap in the previous step.
5. Configure the `<redpanda-version>` variable. Add a Redpanda version, such as `v21.11.11`. You can find all the Redpanda version tags in the [Redpanda Docker Hub repository](https://hub.docker.com/r/redpandadata/redpanda/tags?page=1&ordering=last_updated).
6. Save the file.

### Tutorial: Stegosaurus

To follow along with the stegosaurus tutorial, save the following text locally as a file called `stegosaurus_pod.yaml`:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: stegosaurus_pod
spec:
  containers:
    - name: rpk
      image: 'vectorized/redpanda:latest'
      command:
        - /bin/bash
        - '-c'
      args:
        - sleep infinity
      volumeMounts:
        - mountPath: /etc/tls/certs/ca
          name: ca_volume
        - mountPath: /etc/redpanda
          name: rpk_volume
  restartPolicy: Never
  volumes:
    - name: ca_volume
      secret:
        secretName: cluster-sample-tls-redpanda
    - name: rpk_volume
      configMap:
        name: stegosaurus-config
```

## Step 7: Create the Pod

Run the following command to create the pod:

```bash
kubectl apply -f <tls_pod.yaml>
```

### Tutorial: Stegosaurus

To create the Pod for the stegosaurus tutorial, run this command:

```bash
kubectl apply -f stegosaurus_pod.yaml
```

## Step 8: Connect to Redpanda

Now that you have TLS enabled and the Pod created, you can start using `rpk` to interact with Redpanda. Note that each time you execute an `rpk` command, `rpk` establishes a connection and authenticates the server.

1. Create a topic with this command:

```bash
kubectl exec <pod_name> -- rpk topic create <topic_name>
```

The command contains the following variables:

* `pod_name` - The Pod name that you specified in the Pod configuration file.
* `topic_name` - The name of the topic that you're creating with this command.

2. This command will describe the topic:

```bash
kubectl exec <pod_name> -- rpk topic describe <topic_name>
```

:::note
You do not need to specify the brokers in these commands because they were defined in the ConfigMap. If you include brokers in the `rpk` commands, it will override the brokers in the ConfigMap.
:::

### Tutorial: Stegosaurus

1. For the stegosaurus tutorial, run this command to create a topic called `stegosaurus_topic`:

```bash
kubectl exec stegosaurus_pod -- rpk topic create stegosaurus_topic
```

2. And this command will describe the topic:

```bash
kubectl exec stegosaurus_pod -- rpk topic describe stegosaurus_topic
```

## Step 9: Clean up

You can use the <a href="https://docs.redpanda.com/docs/22.1/reference/rpk-commands/" target="_self">rpk commands</a> documentation to start producing and consuming to your cluster.

When you're ready, delete your cluster and configuration files with the following command:

```bash
kubectl delete -f <cluster_specification.yaml> -f <tls_config_map.yaml> -f <tls_pod.yaml>
```

### Tutorial: Stegosaurus

Use the <a href="https://docs.redpanda.com/docs/22.1/reference/rpk-commands/" target="_self">rpk commands</a> documentation to experiment with producing and consuming to your cluster. When you're ready, delete the cluster and configuration files with this command:

```bash
kubectl delete -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/redpanda-data/redpanda-examples/main/docs/example-config/kubernetes/tls.yaml stegosaurus_config.yaml stegosaurus_pod.yaml
```
