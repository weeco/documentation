When a producer writes messages to a topic, each message should be recorded only once in the order in which it was sent. However, a disruption such as a timeout or a transient connection failure can prevent a write request from succeeding. In such cases, the client retries the write request until one of these events occurs:

* The client receives an acknowledgment from the broker that the write was successful.
* The retry limit is reached.
* The message delivery timeout limit is reached.

Since there is no way to tell if the initial write request succeeded before the disruption, a retry can result in a duplicate message. A retry can also cause subsequent messages to be written out of order.

Idempotent producers prevent this problem by assigning a unique ID to every write request. The request ID consists of the producer ID and a sequence number. The sequence number identifies the order in which each write request was sent. If a retry results in a duplicate message, Redpanda detects and rejects the duplicate message and maintains the original order of the messages.

If new write requests continue while a previous request is being retried, the new requests are stored in the clientâ€™s memory in the order in which they were received. The client must also retry these requests once the previous request is successful.

## Enabling idempotence for producers

The `enable_idempotence` property is enabled by default. This property is set at the cluster level, which means the setting applies to all nodes in the cluster.

Certain client-side settings are required in order for idempotence to work properly. These settings are configured automatically when idempotence is enabled.

Idempotence is guaranteed within a session. A session starts once a producer is created and a connection is established between the client and the Kafka broker.

:::note

Idempotent producers retry unsuccessful write requests automatically. If you manually retry a write request, the client will assign a new ID to that request, which may lead to duplication.

:::

To disable idempotence (and risk duplicate messages as a result of retries), set `enable_idempotence` to `false`. For general instructions on how to edit any cluster property, refer to [Configuring cluster properties](../../cluster-administration/cluster-property-configuration).
