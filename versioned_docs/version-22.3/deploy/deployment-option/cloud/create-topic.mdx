After you create a cluster, you can create a topic for that cluster.

1. From the **Home** page, select the cluster you want to use for creating a topic.
2. From the navigation menu, select **Topics**.

    The **Topics** page displays the current list of topics.
3. Click **Create Topic**.
4. In **Topic Name**, type a name for your topic.
5. (Optional) Fill in the following fields to overwrite the default settings. Defaults are populated from information stored in the broker.

    | Property | Description |
    | ------ | --------- |
    | **Partitions** | The number of partitions for the topic. |
    | **Replication Factor** | The number of partition replicas for the topic. Three replicas are recommended. |
    | **Min In-sync Replicas** | The minimum number of partition replicas that must be kept in sync with the leader partition. This number must be equal to or less than the number of replicas. |
    | **Cleanup Policy** | The policy that determines how to clean up old log segments. The choices are **delete** and **compact**. The default is **delete**. |
    | **Retention Time (ms)** | The maximum length of time to keep messages in a topic. |
    | **Retention Size (Bytes)** | The maximum size of each partition. If a partition reaches this size and more messages are added, the oldest messages are deleted. |
6. (Optional) Under **Additional Configuration**, add more topic properties.

    Redpanda supports all Apache Kafka topic configuration properties and all Redpanda-specific [topic configuration properties](../../../../reference/cluster-properties#topics-and-partitions).
7. Click **Create**.
8. In the success dialog, click **Close**.

The **Topics** page adds the topic you created to the list of topics.
