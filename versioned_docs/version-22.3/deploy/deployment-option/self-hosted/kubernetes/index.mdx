Kubernetes is a container orchestration tool that helps you to manage Redpanda cluster deployments using declarative configuration files called _manifests_. Kubernetes provides a standardized way of achieving high availability, disaster recovery, and scalability.

- [Overview](../kubernetes/kubernetes-production-deployment)

    Learn about Redpanda in Kubernetes and the tools that are available.

- [Production Deployment Workflow](../kubernetes/production-workflow)

    The production deployment tasks involve Kubernetes administrators (admins) as well as Kubernetes users. The admin prepares the cluster with the prerequisites and tunes the worker nodes. The user deploys and configures Redpanda.

    - [Kubernetes Cluster Requirements](../kubernetes/kubernetes-cluster-requirements)

        This topic is a checklist with the prerequisites and system requirements for installing production Redpanda in a Kubernetes cluster using the Helm chart.

    - [Best Practices](../kubernetes/kubernetes-best-practices)

        This topic explains Redpanda's tips and recommendations for Kubernetes deployments.

    - [Tune Worker Nodes](../kubernetes/kubernetes-tune-workers)

        To get the best performance from your hardware, set Redpanda to production mode on each worker node and run the autotuner tool. The autotuner identifies the hardware configuration on your worker node and optimizes the Linux kernel to give you the best performance.

    - [Deploy Redpanda](../kubernetes/kubernetes-deploy)

        This topic describes how to use the Redpanda Helm chart to deploy a Redpanda cluster on Kubernetes.

- [Guides](../kubernetes/get-started-dev)

    Find a guide for setting up a three-broker Redpanda cluster in different Kubernetes platforms.

    - [AKS](../kubernetes/aks-guide)

        This topic explains how to deploy a Redpanda cluster and Redpanda Console in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) using the Helm chart.

    - [EKS](../kubernetes/eks-guide)

        This topic explains how to deploy a Redpanda cluster and Redpanda Console in Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) using the Helm chart.

    - [GKE](../kubernetes/gke-guide)

        This topic explains how to deploy a Redpanda cluster and Redpanda Console in Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) using the Helm chart.

    - [Local (kind and Minikube)](../kubernetes/local-guide)

        This topic explains how to deploy a local Redpanda cluster with Redpanda Console in Kubernetes using the Helm chart.
