- [Kubernetes](../self-hosted/kubernetes)

    - [Overview](../self-hosted/kubernetes/kubernetes-production-deployment)

        Learn about Redpanda in Kubernetes and the tools that are available.

    - [Production Deployment Workflow](../self-hosted/kubernetes/production-workflow)

        The production deployment tasks involve Kubernetes administrators (admins) as well as Kubernetes users. The admin prepares the cluster with the prerequisites and tunes the worker nodes. The user deploys and configures Redpanda.

    - [Guides](../self-hosted/kubernetes/get-started-dev)

        Find a guide for setting up a three-broker Redpanda cluster in different Kubernetes platforms.

- [Manual](../self-hosted/manual)

  - [Deploy for Production](../self-hosted/manual/production/production-deployment)
    
      You can use `rpk` to set up a production cluster of Redpanda using our default deployment or by writing a custom deployment script.

  - [Automate Deployment for Production](../self-hosted/manual/production/production-deployment-automation)
    
      You can use automation tools in your environment such as Terraform and Ansible to deploy Redpanda for production.

  - [Configure Node Properties](../self-hosted/manual/node-property-configuration)

      When you install Redpanda, a `redpanda.yaml` file is installed on each node in `/etc/redpanda`. This file contains node configuration properties. A node property is one that can be set differently from node to node, such as `data_directory` or `node_id` (when specified).

  - [High Availability](../self-hosted/manual/high-availability)

      Redpanda is designed to ensure data integrity and high availability (HA), even at high-throughput levels. This section explains the trade-offs with different configurations.

  - [Sizing Use Cases](../self-hosted/manual/sizing-use-cases)
    
      The following scenarios provide estimates and advice for sizing Redpanda clusters for different throughput and retention use cases in your data center and in the cloud.

  - [Sizing Guidelines](../self-hosted/manual/sizing)

      For the best performance, size your Redpanda cluster to handle the volume of data being produced, replicated, and consumed.
