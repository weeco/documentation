- [Configure Producers](../produce-data/configure-producers)

    Along with brokers, topics, and consumers, producers are one of the essential
    components of a Redpanda deployment. Within streaming applications, producers
    are responsible for sending data to brokers, where the data is stored in topics made
    up of partitions.

- [Idempotent Producers](../produce-data/idempotent-producers)

    When a producer writes messages to a topic, each message should be recorded only once in the order in which it was sent. However, network issues such as a connection failure can result in a timeout, which prevents a write request from succeeding. Idempotent producers prevent this problem by assigning a unique ID to every write request.
