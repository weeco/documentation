Redpanda Community Edition is free and source-available at the [Redpanda GitHub repo](https://github.com/redpanda-data/redpanda). Additional features are included with a license for Redpanda Enterprise Edition.


## Redpanda Community Edition

Redpanda Community Edition is licensed with the Redpanda [Business Source License (BSL)](https://github.com/redpanda-data/redpanda/blob/dev/licenses/bsl.md). These core features are free and source-available. 

:::note
* Users cannot provide Redpanda as a commercial streaming or queuing service to others. 
* The BSL code converts to Apache 2.0 licensing four years after each code merge.

## Redpanda Enterprise Edition

Redpanda Enterprise Edition is licensed with the [Redpanda Community License (RCL)](https://github.com/redpanda-data/redpanda/blob/dev/licenses/rcl.md). It includes the free features licensed under the Redpanda BSL, as well as the following features:

* [Tiered Storage](../../manage/tiered-storage)
* [Data Archiving](../../manage/data-archiving)
* [Continuous Data Balancing](../../manage/cluster-maintenance/continuous-data-balancing)
* [Remote Read Replica](../../manage/remote-read-replicas)
* [Redpanda Console single sign-on authentication](../../manage/security/authentication)
* [Redpanda Console role-based access control](../../manage/security/authorization)

Enterprise features require a license key. You can evaluate enterprise features with a free 30-day trial. Contact [Redpanda Sales](https://redpanda.com/try-redpanda?section=enterprise-cloud) to request a trial license, to extend your trial period, or to purchase an Enterprise Edition license.

### Apply license key

A license key unlocks Redpanda Enterprise Edition features. To apply the license key to your cluster, run:

`rpk cluster license set` 

Either provide a path to a file containing the license, or provide the license string inline. For example, assuming you use the default admin host/port of `0.0.0.0:9644`, run:

`rpk cluster license set --path /home/organization/redpanda.license --api-urls 0.0.0.0:9644`

or 

`rpk cluster license set <license string>`

If neither the path nor the license string are are provided, `rpk` looks for the license in `/etc/redpanda/redpanda.license`. 

### Check license status

To check the status of your current license, run:

`rpk cluster license info --api-urls 0.0.0.0:9644`

Redpanda sends warning messages in the cluster logs if you enable enterprise features without a valid license key.

## Apply a license key to Redpanda Console

To use an Enterprise feature with Redpanda Console, you must provide Redpanda Console with its own copy of your license key.
You have two options for providing the license:

1. Specify the path to the license key file either in the `redpanda.licenseFilepath` property of the `/etc/redpanda/redpanda-console-config.yaml` file, or in the `REDPANDA_LICENSE_FILEPATH` environment variable.
2. Specify the license key file contents directly either in the `redpanda.license` property of the YAML file, or in the `REDPANDA_LICENSE`environment variable.

Redpanda Console checks the license key status on startup and warns you 30 days before the license expires. You can view the license key's expiration date in the startup logs.
If the license key expires at runtime, Redpanda Console shuts down. If the license has already
expired at startup, Redpanda Console prints an error message and exits.
