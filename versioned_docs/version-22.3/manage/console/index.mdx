- [Kafka Connect](../console/kafka-connect)

    Redpanda Console provides a user interface that enables you to manage multiple Kafka connect clusters.
    You can inspect or patch connectors, restart/pause/resume their tasks, and also delete a connector.
    If you have configured more than one cluster, Redpanda Console will query all configured connect
    clusters for their status, so that you can have an overview across all your connect clusters.

- [Schema Registry](../console/schema-registry)

    To deserialize Kafka records that have been encoded with a schema registry compatible serializer, such as  
    `io.confluent.kafka.serializers.KafkaAvroSerializer`, you must have a valid schema registry configuration in Redpanda Console. 

- [Protobuf Deserialization](../console/protobuf)

    If you have one or more topics that contain Protobuf serialized messages, you can configure Redpanda Console to deserialize 
    the binary content into JSON, which makes the message human-readable. The resulting message can also be used in the 
    [programmable push filters](../../reference/console/programmable-push-filters) like a JavaScript object.

- [Topic Documentation](../console/topic-documentation)

    You can embed your topic's documentation into the Redpanda Console user interface by providing access to a GitHub repository that hosts your documentation files in Markdown format. 


- [HTTP Path Rewrites](../console/http-path-rewrites)

    To host Redpanda Console under an HTTP path different from the root path (for example `https://my-company.com/redpanda/console`),
    then you need to configure this in Redpanda Console.
