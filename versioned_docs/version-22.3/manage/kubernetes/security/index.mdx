Redpanda recommends that you always configure encryption, authentication, and authorization for production environments.

## Encryption

- [Configure TLS](../security/kubernetes-tls)

  Use TLS to authenticate Redpanda brokers and encrypt communication between clients and brokers.

## Authentication

- [Configure SASL](../security/sasl-kubernetes)

  Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL) provides authentication between the Redpanda brokers and clients.
