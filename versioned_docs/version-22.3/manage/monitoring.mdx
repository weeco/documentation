Redpanda exports metrics through Prometheus endpoints for you to monitor system health and optimize system performance.

A Redpanda node exports public metrics from the [/public_metrics](../../reference/public-metrics-reference) endpoint through the Admin API port (default: 9644).

Before v22.2, a Redpanda node provided metrics only through the [/metrics](../../reference/internal-metrics-reference) endpoint through the Admin API port. While Redpanda still provides this endpoint, it includes many internal metrics that are unnecessary for a typical Redpanda user to monitor. Consequently, the `/public_metrics` endpoint was added to provide a smaller set of important metrics that can queried and ingested more quickly and inexpensively. The `/metrics` endpoint is now referred to as the 'internal metrics' endpoint, and Redpanda recommends that you use it for development, testing, and analysis.

<MetricsUsageTip/>

:::note
To maximize monitoring performance by minimizing the cardinality of data, some metrics are exported when their underlying features are in use, and are not exported when not in use. For example, a metric for consumer groups, [redpanda_kafka_consumer_group_committed_offset](../../reference/public-metrics-reference#redpanda_kafka_consumer_group_committed_offset), is not exported when no groups are registered.

When monitoring internal metrics, consider enabling [aggregate_metrics](../../reference/cluster-properties#aggregate_metrics) to reduce the cardinality of data to monitor.

## Configure Prometheus

[Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) is a system monitoring and alerting tool. It collects and stores metrics as time-series data identified by a metric name and key/value pairs.

:::note
Redpanda recommends creating monitoring dashboards with `/public_metrics`.
:::

To configure and use Prometheus to monitor Redpanda metrics:

1. Generate the configuration on an existing Prometheus instance.

    - For public metrics, run the command:

        ```bash
        rpk generate prometheus-config
        ```

    - For internal metrics, run the command:

        ```bash
        rpk generate prometheus-config --internal-metrics
        ```

    :::note

    When you run the command on a node where Redpanda is running, it displays other available nodes. If Redpanda is not running, you can either set the `--seed-addr` flag to specify a remote Redpanda node to discover the additional nodes, or set `--node-addrs` with a comma-separated list of known cluster node addresses. For example, use `--node-addrs`:

        ```bash
        rpk generate prometheus-config --job-name redpanda-metrics-test --node-addrs 172.31.18.239:9644,172.31.18.239:9643,172.31.18.239:9642
        ```
    :::

1. Edit the `prometheus.yml` file in the Prometheus root folder to add the Redpanda configuration under `scrape_configs`. Customize `targets` for the names and number of running nodes.

    ```yaml
    scrape_configs:
    - job_name: redpanda-metrics-test
      static_configs:
      - targets:
        - redpanda-0:9644
        - redpanda-1:9644
        - redpanda-2:9644
    metrics_path: /public_metrics
    ```

1. Save the configuration file, and restart Prometheus to apply changes.

1. Observe in Prometheus that metrics from Redpanda endpoints are scraped.

## Generate Grafana dashboard

[Grafana](https://grafana.com/oss/grafana/) is a tool to query, visualize, and generate alerts for metrics.

Redpanda supports generating Grafana dashboards from its metrics endpoints with `rpk generate grafana-dashboard`.

To generate a comprehensive Grafana dashboard, run the following command and pipe the output to a file that can be imported into Grafana:

```
rpk generate grafana-dashboard --datasource <name> --metrics-endpoint <url> > <output-file>
```

- `<name>` is the name of the Prometheus data source configured in your Grafana instance.
- `<url>` is the address to a Redpanda node's metrics endpoint (public or internal).
    
- For `/public_metrics`, for example, run the following command: 

    ```
    rpk generate grafana-dashboard \
    --datasource prometheus \
    --metrics-endpoint <node-addr>:9644/public_metrics> redpanda-dashboard.json 
    ```

- For `/metrics`, for example, run the following command: 

    ```
    rpk generate grafana-dashboard \
    --datasource prometheus \
    --metrics-endpoint <node-addr>:9644/metrics> redpanda-dashboard.json 
    ```

For details about the command, refer to the [rpk generate grafana-dashboard](../../reference/rpk/rpk-generate/rpk-generate-grafana-dashboard) reference.

In Grafana, import the generated JSON file to create a dashboard. Out of the box, Grafana generates panels tracking latency for 50%, 95%, and 99% (based on the maximum latency set), throughput, and error segmentation by type.

To use the imported dashboard to create new panels:

1. Click **+** in the left pane, and select **Add a new panel**. 
1. On the **Query** tab, select **Prometheus** data source. 
1. Decide which metric you want to monitor, click **Metrics browser**, and type `redpanda` to show available public metrics (or `vectorized` for internal metrics) from the Redpanda cluster.

## Use Redpanda monitoring examples 

For hands-on learning, Redpanda provides a repository with examples of monitoring Redpanda with Prometheus and Grafana: [redpanda-data/observability](https://github.com/redpanda-data/observability).

[![Example Redpanda Ops Dashboard](https://github.com/redpanda-data/observability/blob/main/docs/images/Ops%20Dashboard.png?raw=true)](https://github.com/redpanda-data/observability)

It includes [example Grafana dashboards](https://github.com/redpanda-data/observability#grafana-dashboards) and a [sandbox environment](https://github.com/redpanda-data/observability#sandbox-environment) in which you launch a Dockerized Redpanda cluster and create a custom workload to monitor with dashboards.

## Monitor for performance and health

This section provides guidelines and example queries using Redpanda's public metrics to optimize your system's performance and to monitor its health.

:::tip
To help detect and mitigate anomalous system behaviors, capture baseline metrics of your healthy system at different stages (at start-up, under high load, in steady state) so you can set thresholds and alerts according to those baselines.
:::

### Redpanda architecture

Understanding the following unique aspects about Redpanda's architecture and data path will improve your performance debugging and tuning skills:

- Redpanda replicates partitions across nodes in a cluster by using the [Raft consensus protocol](../../get-started/architecture#raft-consensus-algorithm), where each partition is a Raft consensus group. A message written from the Kafka API flows down to the Raft implementation layer that eventually directs it to a node to be stored. Observing metrics about the Raft layer thus can reveal the health of partitions and data flowing within Redpanda.

- Redpanda is designed with a [thread-per-core model](../../get-started/architecture#thread-per-core-model) that it implements with the Seastar library. With each application thread pinned to a CPU core, when observing or analyzing the behavior of a specific application, monitor the relevant metrics with the label for the specific CPU core ("shard"), if available.

### Infrastructure resources

The underlying infrastructure of your system should have sufficient margins to handle peaks in processing, storage, and I/O loads. Monitor infrastructure health with the following queries.

#### CPU usage

For the total CPU uptime, monitor [redpanda_uptime_seconds_total](../../reference/public-metrics-reference#redpanda_uptime_seconds_total). Monitoring its rate of change with the following query can help detect unexpected dips in uptime:

```
rate(redpanda_uptime_seconds_total[5m])
```

For the total CPU busy (non-idle) time, monitor [redpanda_cpu_busy_seconds_total](../../reference/public-metrics-reference#redpanda_cpu_busy_seconds_total). Monitoring its rate of change&mdash;the percentage a CPU core ("shard") is in use at a given point in time&mdash;with the following query can help detect unexpected idling:

```
rate(redpanda_cpu_busy_seconds_total[5m])
```

#### Memory allocated

To monitor the percentage of memory allocated, use a formula with [redpanda_memory_allocated_memory](../../reference/public-metrics-reference#redpanda_memory_allocated_memory) and [redpanda_memory_free_memory](../../reference/public-metrics-reference#redpanda_memory_free_memory):

```
sum(redpanda_memory_allocated_memory) / (sum(redpanda_memory_free_memory) + sum(redpanda_memory_allocated_memory))
```

#### Disk used

To monitor the percentage of disk consumed, use a formula with [redpanda_storage_disk_free_bytes](../../reference/public-metrics-reference#redpanda_storage_disk_free_bytes) and [redpanda_storage_disk_total_bytes](../../reference/public-metrics-reference#redpanda_storage_disk_total_bytes): 

```
1 - (sum(redpanda_storage_disk_free_bytes) / sum(redpanda_storage_disk_total_bytes))
```

Also monitor [redpanda_storage_disk_free_space_alert](../../reference/public-metrics-reference#redpanda_storage_disk_free_space_alert) for an alert when available disk space is low or degraded.

#### IOPS

For read and write I/O operations per second (IOPS), monitor the [redpanda_io_queue_total_read_ops](../../reference/public-metrics-reference#redpanda_io_queue_total_read_ops) and [redpanda_io_queue_total_write_ops](../../reference/public-metrics-reference#redpanda_io_queue_total_write_ops) counters: 

```
rate(redpanda_io_queue_total_read_ops[5m]),
rate(redpanda_io_queue_total_write_ops[5m])
```


### Throughput

While maximizing the rate of messages moving from producers to brokers then to consumers depends on tuning each of those components, the total throughput of all topics provides a system-level metric to monitor. Then when you observe abnormal, unhealthy spikes or dips in producer or consumer throughput, look for correlation with changes in the number of active connections ([redpanda_rpc_active_connections](../../reference/public-metrics-reference#redpanda_rpc_active_connections)) and logged errors to drill down to the root cause.

The total throughput of a cluster can be measured by the producer and consumer rates across all topics.

To observe the total producer and consumer rates of a cluster, monitor [redpanda_kafka_request_bytes_total](../../reference/public-metrics-reference#redpanda_kafka_request_bytes_total) with the `produce` and `consume` labels, respectively. 

#### Producer throughput

For the produce rate, create a query to get the produce rate across all topics:

```
sum(rate(redpanda_kafka_request_bytes_total{redpanda_request="produce"} [5m] )) by (redpanda_request)
```

#### Consumer throughput

For the consume rate, create a query to get the total consume rate across all topics:

```
sum(rate(redpanda_kafka_request_bytes_total{redpanda_request="consume"} [5m] )) by (redpanda_request)
```

### Latency

Latency should be consistent between produce and fetch sides. It should also be consistent over time. Take periodic snapshots of produce and fetch latencies, including at upper percentiles (95%, 99%), and watch out for significant changes over a short duration.

In Redpanda the latency of produce and fetch requests includes the latency of internal inter-node RPCs that are born from Redpanda's internal implementation using Raft.

#### Kafka consumer latency

To monitor Kafka consumer request latency, use the [redpanda_kafka_request_latency_seconds](../../reference/public-metrics-reference#redpanda_kafka_request_latency_seconds) histogram with the label `redpanda_request="consume"`. For example, create a query for the 99th percentile:

```
histogram_quantile(0.99, sum(rate(redpanda_kafka_request_latency_seconds_bucket{redpanda_request="consume"}[5m])) by (le, provider, region, instance, namespace, pod))
```

You can monitor the rate of Kafka consumer requests using`redpanda_kafka_request_latency_seconds_count` with the `redpanda_request="consume"` label:

```
rate(redpanda_kafka_request_latency_seconds_count{redpanda_request="consume"}[5m])
```

#### Kafka producer latency

To monitor Kafka producer request latency, use the [redpanda_kafka_request_latency_seconds](../../reference/public-metrics-reference#redpanda_kafka_request_latency_seconds) histogram with the `redpanda_request="produce"` label. For example, create a query for the 99th percentile:

```
histogram_quantile(0.99, sum(rate(redpanda_kafka_request_latency_seconds_bucket{redpanda_request="produce"}[5m])) by (le, provider, region, instance, namespace, pod))
```

You can monitor the rate of Kafka producer requests with `redpanda_kafka_request_latency_seconds_count` with the `redpanda_request="produce"` label:

```
rate(redpanda_kafka_request_latency_seconds_count{redpanda_request="produce"}[5m])
```

#### Internal RPC latency

To monitor Redpanda internal RPC latency, use the [redpanda_rpc_request_latency_seconds](../../reference/public-metrics-reference#redpanda_rpc_request_latency_seconds) histogram. For example, create a query for the 99th percentile latency:   

```
histogram_quantile(0.99, (sum(rate(redpanda_rpc_request_latency_seconds_bucket[5m])) by (le, provider, region, instance, namespace, pod, redpanda_server)))
```

You can monitor the rate of internal RPC requests with [redpanda_rpc_request_latency_seconds](../../reference/public-metrics-reference#redpanda_rpc_request_latency_seconds) histogram's count:

```
rate(redpanda_rpc_request_latency_seconds_count[5m])
```


### Partition health

The health of Kafka partitions often reflects the health of the broker nodes that host them. Thus, when alerts occur for conditions such as under-replicated partitions or more frequent leadership transfers, check for unresponsive or unavailable brokers.

With Redpanda's internal implementation of the Raft consensus protocol, the health of partitions is also reflected in any errors in the internal RPCs exchanged between Raft peers.

#### Leadership changes

Stable clusters have a consistent balance of leaders across all nodes, with few to no leadership transfers between nodes.

To observe changes in leadership, monitor the [redpanda_raft_leadership_changes](../../reference/public-metrics-reference#redpanda_raft_leadership_changes) counter. For example, use a query to get the total rate of increase of leadership changes for a cluster:

```
sum(rate(redpanda_raft_leadership_changes{redpanda_cloud_data_cluster_name=<cluster-name>}[5m]))
```
 
#### Under-replicated partitions

A healthy cluster has partition data fully replicated across its brokers. 

An under-replicated partition is at higher risk of data loss. It also adds latency because messages must be replicated before being committed. To know when a partition isn't fully replicated, create an alert for the [redpanda_kafka_under_replicated_replicas](../../reference/public-metrics-reference#redpanda_kafka_under_replicated_replicas) gauge when it is greater than zero:

```
redpanda_kafka_under_replicated_replicas > 0
```

Under-replication can be caused by unresponsive brokers. When an alert on `redpanda_kafka_under_replicated_replicas` is triggered, identify the problem broker(s) and examine their log(s). 

#### Leaderless partitions

A healthy cluster has a leader for every partition. 

A partition without a leader cannot exchange messages with producers or consumers. To identify when a partition doesn't have a leader, create an alert for the [redpanda_cluster_unavailable_partitions](../../reference/public-metrics-reference#redpanda_cluster_unavailable_partitions) gauge when it is greater than zero: 

```
redpanda_cluster_unavailable_partitions > 0
```

Leaderless partitions can be caused by unresponsive brokers. When an alert on `redpanda_cluster_unavailable_partitions` is triggered, identify the problem broker(s) and examine their log(s). 

#### Raft RPCs

Redpanda's Raft implementation exchanges periodic status RPCs between a node and its peers. The [redpanda_node_status_rpcs_timed_out](../../reference/public-metrics-reference#redpanda_node_status_rpcs_timed_out) gauge increases when a status RPC times out for a peer, which indicates a peer may be unresponsive and may lead to problems with partition replication that Raft manages. Monitor for non-zero values of this gauge, and correlate it with any logged errors or changes partition replication.


### Consumers

#### Consumer group lag

When working with Kafka consumer groups, the consumer group lag&mdash;the difference between the broker's latest (max) offset and the group's last committed offset&mdash;is a performance indicator of how fresh the data being consumed is. While higher lag for archival consumers is expected, high lag for real-time consumers could indicate that the consumers are overloaded and thus may need their topics to be partitioned more, or to spread the load to more consumers.   

To monitor consumer group lag, create a query with the [redpanda_kafka_max_offset](../../reference/public-metrics-reference#redpanda_kafka_max_offset) and [redpanda_kafka_consumer_group_committed_offset](../../reference/public-metrics-reference#redpanda_kafka_consumer_group_committed_offset) gauges:

```
max by(redpanda_namespace, redpanda_topic, redpanda_partition)(redpanda_kafka_max_offset{redpanda_namespace="kafka"}) - on(redpanda_topic, redpanda_partition) group_right max by(redpanda_group, redpanda_topic, redpanda_partition)(redpanda_kafka_consumer_group_committed_offset)
```

### Services

Monitor the health of specific Redpanda services with the following metrics. 

#### Schema registry

Schema Registry request latency:

```
histogram_quantile(0.99, (sum(rate(redpanda_schema_registry_request_latency_seconds_bucket[5m])) by (le, provider, region, instance, namespace, pod)))
```

Schema Registry request rate:

```
rate(redpanda_schema_registry_request_latency_seconds_count[5m]) + sum without(redpanda_status)(rate(redpanda_schema_registry_request_errors_total[5m]))
```

Schema Registry request error rate:

```
rate(redpanda_schema_registry_request_errors_total[5m])
```

#### REST proxy

REST proxy request latency:

```    
histogram_quantile(0.99, (sum(rate(redpanda_rest_proxy_request_latency_seconds_bucket[5m])) by (le, provider, region, instance, namespace, pod)))
```

REST proxy request rate:

```
rate(redpanda_rest_proxy_request_latency_seconds_count[5m]) + sum without(redpanda_status)(rate(redpanda_rest_proxy_request_errors_total[5m]))
```

REST proxy request error rate:

```
rate(redpanda_rest_proxy_request_errors_total[5m])
```
