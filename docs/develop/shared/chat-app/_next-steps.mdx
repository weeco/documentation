This is a basic example of a chat room application. You can improve this application by implementing additional features and components, such as:

- A user interface to make it more interactive and user-friendly.
- A user registration and login system to authenticate users before they can access the chat room.
- Rate limiting and other measures to prevent spamming and abuse in the chat room.
