Create a basic chat room application with Redpanda and Kafka clients developed with [kafka-python](https://kafka-python.readthedocs.io/en/master/).

<Intro/>

## Prerequisites

Download and install Python 3 from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads).

## Set up a Redpanda environment

<SetUpDocker frontmatter={frontMatter}/>

## Set up your environment

1. Create and set your working directory to the project folder, `chat-room`:

   ```bash
   mkdir chat-room
   cd chat-room
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment:

  ```bash
  python3 -m venv .env
  source .env/bin/activate
  ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

  ```bash
  pip3 install kafka-python
  ```

## Create a topic

You need a topic named `chat-room` for both Redpanda and the client to use to store chat room messages. If you completed the Redpanda Quickstart, this topic already exists in your cluster.

1. Verify that the `chat-room` topic exists in your cluster by listing all topics:

  ```bash
  docker exec -it redpanda-0 rpk topic list
  ```

  Output:

  ```
  NAME       PARTITIONS  REPLICAS
  chat-room  1           1
  ```

1. If the topic doesn't exist yet, use [rpk](../../reference/rpk) to create a `chat-room` topic:

  ```bash
  docker exec -it redpanda-0 rpk topic create chat-room
  ```

  Output:

  ```
  TOPIC      STATUS
  chat-room  OK
  ```

## Confirm that the topic exists on the client side

The client may not always know that the topic exists. You can verify that it exists and create it if not. In `chat-room/` create a source file called `admin.py` with the following content.

```python title="admin.py"
from kafka import KafkaAdminClient
from kafka.admin import NewTopic

from kafka.admin import KafkaAdminClient, NewTopic

class ChatAdmin:
  def __init__(self, brokers):
    self.admin = KafkaAdminClient(bootstrap_servers=brokers)

  def topic_exists(self, topic_name):
    topics_metadata = self.admin.list_topics()
    return topic_name in topics_metadata

  def create_topic(self, topic_name, num_partitions=1, replication_factor=1):
    if not self.topic_exists(topic_name):
      new_topic = NewTopic(name=topic_name, num_partitions=num_partitions, replication_factor=replication_factor)
      self.admin.create_topics([new_topic])
      print(f"Topic {topic_name} created.")
    else:
      print(f"Topic {topic_name} already exists.")

  def close(self):
    self.admin.close()
```

## Create a producer

A client needs a producer to publish `chat-room` topic messages.

To create a producer for the client, in `chat-room/` create a source file `producer.py` with the following content.

```python title="producer.py"
from kafka import KafkaProducer
import json

class ChatProducer:
  def __init__(self, brokers, topic):
    self.topic = topic
    self.producer = KafkaProducer(
      bootstrap_servers=brokers,
      value_serializer=lambda v: json.dumps(v).encode("utf-8"),
    )

  def send_message(self, user, message):
    self.producer.send(self.topic, {"user": user, "message": message})
    self.producer.flush()

  def close(self):
    self.producer.close()
```

You now have a working producer that sends strings entered by the user to the
`chat-room` topic. Messages are sent as JSON encoded strings here,
but keep in mind that the producer only sends buffers, so you can encode the
messages however you like.

## Create a consumer

A client needs a consumer to receive `chat-room` topic messages.

To create a consumer for the client, in `chat-room/` create a source file `consumer.py` with the following content.

```python title="consumer.py"
from kafka import KafkaConsumer
import json
import uuid

class ChatConsumer:
  def __init__(self, brokers, topic, group_id=None):
    if group_id is None:
      group_id = str(uuid.uuid4())

    self.consumer = KafkaConsumer(
      topic,
      bootstrap_servers=brokers,
      group_id=group_id,
      value_deserializer=lambda m: json.loads(m.decode("utf-8")),
    )

  def print_messages(self):
    for msg in self.consumer:
      print(f"{msg.value['user']}: {msg.value['message']}")

  def close(self):
    self.consumer.close()
```

You now have a consumer that reads all messages from the `chat-room`
topic and prints them to the console. You can start as many consumer groups as
you like, but remember that each group reads a message only once, which is
why the example is using a generated UUID for the group ID.

## Create a client application

The client needs an application that creates the topic, producer, and consumer and implements the chat logic.

To create a client application, in `chat-room/` create a source file `app.py` with the following content.

:::note
The broker settings in this code are from the Redpanda Quickstart, where the external port for broker `redpanda-0` is set to port 19092. If you're not using the Redpanda Quickstart, make sure that the broker's port is correct for your deployment.
:::

```python title="app.py"
import threading
from producer import ChatProducer
from consumer import ChatConsumer
from admin import ChatAdmin

brokers = ["localhost:19092"]
topic = "chat-room"

def consumer_thread(consumer):
  consumer.print_messages()

if __name__ == "__main__":
  admin = ChatAdmin(brokers)
  if not admin.topic_exists(topic):
    print(f"Creating topic: {topic}")
    admin.create_topic(topic)

  username = input("Enter your username: ")

  producer = ChatProducer(brokers, topic)
  consumer = ChatConsumer(brokers, topic)

  consumer_t = threading.Thread(target=consumer_thread, args=(consumer,))
  consumer_t.daemon = True
  consumer_t.start()
  print("Connected. Press Ctrl+C to exit")

  try:
    while True:
      message = input()
      producer.send_message(username, message)
  except KeyboardInterrupt:
    pass
  finally:
    print("\nClosing chat...")
    producer.close()
    consumer.close()
    admin.close()
    consumer_t.join(1)
```

## Build and run the application

Build the client chat application, run it from multiple client terminals, and chat between the clients.

1. Open at least two terminals, and for each terminal:

  1. Run the client application:

    ```
    python app.py
    ```

  1. When prompted with `Enter user name:`, enter a unique name for the chat room.

1. Use the chat application: enter a message in a terminal, and verify that the message is received in the other terminals.

  For example:

  ```
  Enter user name:
  Alice
  Connected, press Ctrl+C to exit
  Alice: Hi, I'm Alice
  Bob: Hi Alice, I'm Bob, nice to meet you
  ```
