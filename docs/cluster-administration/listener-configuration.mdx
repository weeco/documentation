Apache Kafka® client libraries must be able to connect to every Redpanda broker
instance. If the client and broker exist on different subnets, then Redpanda
must be configured to advertise its location, so other brokers in
the cluster can be found. If not, clients connecting to brokers outside
their local network experience connectivity issues.

To try out Redpanda, see the Getting Started Guides for
[Linux](/docs/quickstart/quick-start-linux), [MacOS](/docs/quickstart/quick-start-macos),
[Docker](/docs/quickstart/quick-start-docker), or [Kubernetes](/docs/quickstart/kubernetes-qs-cloud).

## Anatomy of a listener

Clients must connect to Redpanda with a TCP socket. A TCP socket is described by an IP address of an interface and a port on the machine that Redpanda runs on. For example:

```yaml
redpanda:
  kafka_api:
    - address: 0.0.0.0
      port: 9092
```

An address of `0.0.0.0` means that Redpanda listens on all interfaces.

## Advertise a listener

If the client exists on another subnet, then it needs to be informed of how to reach Redpanda. This is done by configuring the advertised address of the Kafka API.

For example, if Redpanda is running on the subnet `192.168.4.0/24` with IP address `192.168.4.1`, and the clients are running on the subnet `192.168.5.0/24`:

```yaml
redpanda:
  advertised_kafka_api:
    - address: 192.168.4.1
      port: 9092
```

The client machine requires a gateway configured to route requests to `192.168.4.1`.

It's also possible to advertise a host name, provided the client can resolve the DNS and has a route to the host.

## Multiple listeners

Sometimes it's useful to have multiple configurations for accessing Redpanda with multiple routes.

This is possible by creating multiple listeners, and providing a name for the listener. The name is used to connect the listener and its advertised address. For example:

```yaml
redpanda:
  kafka_api:
    - name: local
      address: 127.0.0.1
      port: 9092
    - name: subnet
      address: 192.168.4.1
      port: 9093
  advertised_kafka_api:
    - name: local
      address: 127.0.0.1
      port: 9092
    - name: subnet
      address: 192.168.4.1
      port: 9093
```

It's also possible to create additional listeners for different configurations of TLS or authentication.

## Mixed-mode authentication with multiple listeners

Redpanda supports using both SASL and mTLS principal extraction authentication methods using multiple listeners. This supports a variety of Kafka clients using various authentication schemes all connecting to your cluster. For example:

```yaml
redpanda:
  kafka_api:
    - address: 0.0.0.0
      port: 9092
      name: sasl_listener
      authentication_method: sasl
  kafka_api:
    - address: 0.0.0.0
      port: 9092
      name: mtls_listener
      authentication_method: mtls_identity
  kafka_api_tls:
    - name: mtls_listener
      key_file: mtls_server.key
      cert_file: mtls_server.crt
      truststore_file: mtls_ca.crt
      enabled: true
      require_client_auth: true
```

## Listeners that can be advertised

* `kafka_api` -> `advertised_kafka_api`
* `rpc_server` -> `advertised_rpc_server` (Only a single listener is supported and is used for Redpanda instances to talk to each other.)
* `pandaproxy_api` -> `advertised_pandaproxy_api`
