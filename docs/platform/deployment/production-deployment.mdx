This section describes how to set up a production cluster of Redpanda.

See also:
- [Managing Disk Space](../../deployment/disk-utilization) for guidelines on cluster creation
- [Install and Upgrade](../../install-upgrade/) to try out Redpanda

## Prepare infrastructure

For best performance, provision hardware according to these requirements:

- XFS for the data directory of Redpanda (`/var/lib/redpanda/data`)
- A kernel that is at least 3.10.0-514, 4.18 or newer
- Local NVMe, RAID-0 when using multiple disks
- 2GB of memory per core
- TCP ports:
  - `33145` - internal RPC
  - `9092` - Kafka API
  - `8082` - HTTP Proxy
  - `8081` - Schema Registry
  - `9644` - Prometheus and Admin API

:::note
You can [use Terraform to deploy Redpanda](../../deployment/production-deployment-automation).

## Install the Redpanda binary

Install the binary on either Fedora/RedHat or Debian systems.

You can also install Redpanda using an [Ansible playbook](../../deployment/production-deployment-automation).

```bash
curl -1sLf 'https://dl.redpanda.com/nzc4ZYQK3WRGd9sy/redpanda/cfg/setup/bash.rpm.sh' | \
sudo -E bash && sudo yum install redpanda -y
```

  <TabItem value="debian" label="Debian">

```bash
curl -1sLf 'https://dl.redpanda.com/nzc4ZYQK3WRGd9sy/redpanda/cfg/setup/bash.deb.sh' | \
sudo -E bash && sudo apt install redpanda -y
```

## Set Redpanda production mode

By default, Redpanda is installed in development mode, which turns off hardware optimization.

To enable hardware optimization, set Redpanda to run in production mode:

```bash
sudo rpk redpanda mode production
```

To tune the hardware, on each node, run:

```bash
sudo rpk redpanda tune all
```

:::note Optional: Benchmark your SSD
On taller machines, Redpanda recommends benchmarking your SSD. This can be done
with `rpk iotune`. You only need to run this once. 

For reference, a local NVMe SSD should yield around 1GB/s sustained writes.
`rpk iotune` captures SSD wear and tear and gives accurate measurements
of what your hardware is capable of delivering. Run this before benchmarking.

If you're on AWS, GCP, or Azure, creating a new instance and upgrading to
an image with a recent Linux kernel version is often the easiest way to
work around bad devices.

```bash
sudo rpk iotune # takes 10mins
```

:::

## Configure and start seed nodes

Configure and start up the seed servers with the [`rpk config bootstrap`](../../reference/rpk/rpk-redpanda/rpk-redpanda-config-bootstrap) command: 

```bash
sudo rpk config bootstrap --self <private ip> --ips <seed nodes ips> \ 
sudo systemctl start redpanda-tuner redpanda
```

- The `--self` flag tells the node which interface address to bind to. Usually this is its private IP.
- The `--ips` flag must be identical on all nodes when deploying a cluster for the first time.

A Redpanda cluster starts with the seed nodes that are specified in the `--ips` flag, instantiating a controller Raft group with the seed nodes. The cluster grows as nodes start up and is available after all seed servers are up. 

:::info
- Redpanda strongly recommends at least three seed nodes when forming a cluster. A larger number of seed nodes increases the robustness of consensus and minimizes any chance that new clusters get spuriously formed after nodes are lost or restarted without any data.
- It's important to have one or more seed nodes in each fault domain (such as rack or cloud AZ). A higher number provides a stronger guarantee that clusters don’t fracture unintentionally.
- It's possible to change the seed nodes for a short period of time after a cluster has been created. For example, you may want to designate one additional node as a seed node to increase availability. To do this without cluster downtime, add the new node to [`seed_servers`](../../reference/node-properties/) and restart Redpanda to apply the change on a node-by-node basis.
:::

If clients will connect from a different subnet, see [Configuring Listeners](../../cluster-administration/listener-configuration).

## Configure and start other nodes

Let every other node know where to reach the seed nodes:

```bash
sudo rpk config bootstrap --self <private ip> --ips <seed nodes ips> \ 
sudo systemctl start redpanda-tuner redpanda
```

## Verify the installation

To verify that the cluster is up and running, check the logs:

```bash
journalctl -u redpanda
```

If topics were initially created in a test environment with a replication factor of `1`, use `rpk topic alter-config` to change the topic replication factor: 

```
rpk topic alter-config [TOPICS...] --set replication.factor 3
```

To create a topic:

```bash
rpk topic create panda
```
