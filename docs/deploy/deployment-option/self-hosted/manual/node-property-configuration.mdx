When you install Redpanda, a `redpanda.yaml` file is installed on each node in `/etc/redpanda`. This file contains node configuration properties. A node property is one that can be set differently from node to node, such as `data_directory` or `node_id` (when specified).

See [Node Configuration Properties](../../../../../reference/node-properties) for a list of node properties, their descriptions, and their default values.

The default `redpanda.yaml` file groups node properties into categories:

- `pandaproxy` - properties for the Redpanda HTTP Proxy
- `redpanda` - runtime configuration properties, such as the cluster member IP addresses and the data directory
- `rpk` - properties that determine how `rpk` starts Redpanda
- `schema registry` - properties related to storage, retrieval, and compatibility of the schemas

To view a sample template that includes all node properties as they appear in the default `redpanda.yaml` file, see [Node Configuration Template](../../../../../reference/node-configuration-sample). This template is annotated with descriptions of each property.

## Set node configuration properties

The `redpanda.yaml` file rarely needs to be edited after the system is installed, but you can choose to change node configuration property values.

:::caution
The one node configuration property you cannot change is the unique node identifier: `node_id`. After a node joins the cluster, do not change the `node_id`. You can altogether omit `node_id` from `redpanda.yaml` and have Redpanda assign it automatically. For more information, see [Configure node IDs](../../manual/production/production-deployment/#configure-node-ids).
:::

To change a node property setting:

1. Open a terminal window and navigate to the node where you want to change a property setting.

2. Go to the `/etc/redpanda` directory.

3. Open the `redpanda.yaml` file.

4. Change values for properties as needed.

5. Save the file and close the editor.

6. Restart the node to apply the changes.

When Redpanda starts up and reads the `redpanda.yaml` file, it checks that each property setting has a valid value. If the file contains an invalid property setting, Redpanda logs an error and refuses to start.
