You can deploy Redpanda for production on [bare metal with the Redpanda installation binary](../../production/production-deployment).

If you use automation tools in your environment, like Terraform and Ansible, you can use those tools for your Redpanda production deployment.

## Set up infrastructure with Terraform

1. Install Terraform. See the [Terraform documentation](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli).

2. To clone the `deployment-automation` repo:

 ```bash
 git clone https://github.com/redpanda-data/deployment-automation.git
 ```

3. To change into the directory:

 ```bash
 cd deployment-automation
 ```

4. Follow the specific instructions for AWS or GCP:


<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="aws" label="AWS" default>

  1. Within the `deployment-automation` folder, change into the `aws` directory:

    ```bash
    cd aws
    ```

  2. Set AWS credentials. Terraform provides multiple ways to set the AWS secret and key. See the [Terraform documentation](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#environment-variables).

  3. To initialize Terraform:

    ```bash
    terraform init
    ```

  4. To create the cluster: 
   
    `terraform apply` 
    
    Configuration options:

    | Property      | Description |
    | ----------- | ----------- |
    | `aws_region` | The AWS region to use for deploying the infrastructure. Default: `us-west-2` |
    | `nodes` | The number of nodes to base the cluster on. Default: `3` |
    | `enable_monitoring` | Creates a Prometheus/Grafana instance for monitoring the cluster. Default: `true` |
    | `instance_type` | The instance type on which Redpanda is deployed. Default: `i3.8xlarge` |
    | `prometheus_instance_type` | The instance type on which Prometheus and Grafana are deployed. Default: `c5.2xlarge` |
    | `public_key_path` | Path to the public key of the keypair used to access the nodes. Default: `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub` |
    | `distro` | Linux distribution to install. (This affects the `distro_` variables.) Default: `ubuntu-focal` |
    | `distro_ami` | AWS AMI to use for each available distribution. These must be changed according to the chosen AWS region. |
    | `distro_ssh_user` | User used to ssh into the created EC2 instances. |
 
    The following example creates a three-node cluster using i3.large instances.

    ```bash
    terraform apply -var="instance_type=i3.large"
    ```


  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="gcp" label="GCP">

  1. Within the `deployment-automation` folder, change into the `gcp` directory:

    ```bash
    cd gcp
    ```

  2. You need an existing subnet to deploy the VMs into. The subnet's attached firewall should allow inbound traffic on ports 22, 3000, 8082, 8888, 8889, 9090,  9092, 9644, and 33145. This module adds the `rp-node` tag to the deployed VMs, which can be used as the target tag for the firewall rule.

  3. To initialize Terraform:

    ```bash
    terraform init
    ```

  4. To create the cluster: 
 
    `terraform apply`
   
    Configuration options:
   
    | Property      | Description |
    | ----------- | ----------- |
    | `region` | The region to use for deploying the infrastructure. Default: `us-west1` |
    | `zone` | The region's zone to deploy the infrastructure. Default: `a` |
    | `subnet` | The name of an existing subnet to deploy the infrastructure. |
    | `nodes` | The number of nodes to base the cluster on. Keep in mind that one node is used as a monitoring node. Default: `1`|
    | `disks` | The number of local disks to deploy on each machine. Default = `1`|
    | `image` | The OS image running on the VMs. Default: `ubuntu-os-cloud/ubuntu-1804-lts` |
    | `machine_type` | The machine type. Default: `n2-standard-2`|
    | `public_key_path` | Path to the public key of the keypair used to access the nodes. |
    | `ssh_user` | The ssh user. Must match the one in the public ssh key's comments. |

   The following example creates a three-node cluster using the subnet named `redpanda-cluster-subnet`.

    ```bash
    terraform apply -var nodes=3 -var subnet=redpanda-cluster-subnet -var public_key_path=~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub -var ssh_user=$USER
    ```

### Next steps

Now you can install Redpanda either with the [Redpanda installation binary](../../production/production-deployment) or with Ansible.

## Install Redpanda with Ansible

Whether you are using bare metal servers or Terraform, you can use Ansible to install Redpanda.

### Prerequisites

Install Ansible. See the [Ansible documentation](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html).

### Clone the GitHub repository

To clone the repo:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:redpanda-data/deployment-automation.git
```

To change into the directory:

```bash
cd deployment-automation
```

To install the required roles needed by Ansible:

```bash
ansible-galaxy install -r ansible/requirements.yml
```

### Configure the hosts.ini file

The `hosts.ini` file is in the `deployment-automation` directory. If you used Terraform to deploy the instances, this file is updated automatically. If you did not use Terraform, you must update it
manually. When you open the file, and you see something like the following:

```ini
[redpanda]
ip ansible_user=ssh_user ansible_become=True private_ip=pip id=0
ip ansible_user=ssh_user ansible_become=True private_ip=pip id=1

[monitor]
ip ansible_user=ssh_user ansible_become=True private_ip=pip id=1
```

Under the `[redpanda]` section, replace the following:

| Property      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| `ip` | The public IP address of the machine. |
| `ansible_user` | The username for Ansible to use to ssh to the machine. |
| `private_ip` | The private IP address of the machine. This could be the same as the public IP address. |
| `id` | The node ID of the Redpanda instance. This must be unique for each host. |

The `[monitor]` section is only relevant if you have Prometheus and Grafana installed
on a given host. If you don't want to have this deployed, then remove the
`[monitor]` section.

### Run the Ansible playbook

To set up Redpanda on your selected nodes:

```bash
ansible-playbook --private-key <your_private_key> -i hosts.ini -v ansible/playbooks/provision-node.yml
```

After this completes, you have a fully running cluster.
