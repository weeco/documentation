## Architecture

Redpanda Cloud offers fully managed and dedicated Redpanda clusters as a service,
which you can deploy in your cloud account or in the Redpanda Cloud, either in AWS
or GCP. Redpanda Cloud continuously monitors and maintains your Redpanda clusters
along with the underlying Redpanda Cloud infrastructure to meet strict performance,
availability, reliability, and security requirements. These clusters are also
deployed with an integrated and dedicated Redpanda Console and, optionally, with
a fully managed Kafka Connect and Connectors cluster as well.

Redpanda Cloud supports Dedicated clusters and Bring Your Own Cloud (BYOC) clusters,
which are clusters running in your cloud account.

Redpanda Cloud employs a control plane and data plane architecture that ensures
no human has direct access to Redpanda brokers or customer data.

* Control plane
  The control plane is a separate entity that resides above and enforces rules
  in the data plane. The control plane is where a good deal of your Redpanda
  cluster management, operations, and maintenance takes place. While Redpanda
  Cloud clusters are configured and maintained in the control plane, they are
  self-contained and remain available even if your network connection to the
  control plane is lost.

* Data plane
  The data plane is where your data resides in Redpanda Cloud; it is
  self-contained and managed by an agent that receives instructions from the
  control plane. Redpanda Cloud clusters are interchangeably referred to as
  data planes. All network connections into the data plane take place through
  either a public endpoint or a Redpanda Cloud [VPC peering network connection](../vpc-peering).

* Agent
  The Redpanda Cloud agent, also known as the data plane agent, provisions,
  configures and maintains all the resources in the Redpanda Cloud cluster, from
  the network all the way up to the Redpanda cluster and Connectors infrastructure.
  Agent resources include cloud infrastructure, Kubernetes, and data plane software
  artifacts.

  Agents can be bootstrapped in two different ways: automatically by a machine
  or manually by a human. The human-driven agent bootstrap is designed for
  the Redpanda Cloud BYOC deployment type. After the agent is up and running,
  it connects to the control plane and starts dequeuing and running instructions
  to provision, configure, and maintain Redpanda Cloud clusters.

  The agent is in constant communication with the Redpanda Cloud control plane,
  receiving and running commands and exchanging metadata. Agents are authenticated
  and authorized through opaque and ephemeral tokens, and have dedicated command
  queues in the control plane. In BYOC, you can provision, configure, and
  maintain agents using rpk.

  Redpanda Cloud agents also manage Redpanda Cloud VPC peering networks. However,
  only one agent manages each network resource at a time.

  The following diagram identifies the resources, operations, and connections
  that exist in and between the Redpanda Cloud control plane and data plane.

## Ways to provision clusters

Redpanda offers two ways to provision clusters in the cloud:
* Dedicated Cloud
* Bring Your Own Cloud (BYOC)

Both methods offer the following features:
* Single-zone or multi-zone availability
    * A single-zone cluster is deployed in one availability zone. If that
      availability zone fails, the cluster becomes unavailable.
    * A multi-zone cluster is deployed across three availability zones, which
      provides higher resiliency in the event of a failure in one of the zones.
* Private networking using VPC peering
* Ability to export metrics to a 3rd-party monitoring system
* [Managed connectors](../managed-connectors)
* Unlimited retention with Tiered Storage

### Dedicated cloud

With the Dedicated Cloud, you host your data in Redpanda’s Virtual Private Cloud
(VPC), and Redpanda handles provisioning, operations, and maintenance. Redpanda
also performs automatic backups to S3 (for AWS) or GCS (for GCP).

Dedicated clusters are single-tenant deployments launched from the Redpanda
control plane. The Redpanda cluster is created in Redpanda’s VPC, and the
endpoints are exposed so you can produce or consume events.

### BYOC

When you choose BYOC, you deploy Redpanda in your own VPC, so that all data is
contained in your own environment. There is no outbound connection from your VPC
to the Redpanda VPC in the control or data path, which provides an additional
layer of security and isolation.

Redpanda handles provisioning, monitoring, and upgrades. You can choose AWS or
GCP as your cloud provider.

Setting up a BYOC cluster is initiated from the Redpanda control plane. This is
a two-step process:
1. You bootstrap a Virtual Machine (VM) in your VPC. This VM spins up the agent
   and the required infrastructure.
2. The agent communicates with the control plane to pull the control commands.
