- [Amazon S3 Sink Connector](../managed-connectors/create-s3-sink-connector)

    A connector subscribes to specified Kafka topics and collects messages. The connector periodically dumps the messages to a specified location, such as an S3 bucket or a GCS bucket. You can create a connector, managed by Redpanda, directly from the Redpanda Console.
