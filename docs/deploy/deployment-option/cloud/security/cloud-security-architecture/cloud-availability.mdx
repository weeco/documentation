Redpanda Cloud supports the deployment of Redpanda clusters in single or multiple
Availability Zones (AZ), spanning at most three AZs. Nodes are evenly distributed
across AZs and [default_topic_replications](../../../../../../reference/cluster-properties#default_topic_replications)
is set to `3` by default.

Data is also evenly distributed across AZs automatically. This behavior is also
known as rack or AZ awareness.

To prevent downtime during Redpanda Cloud cluster upgrades, the Redpanda Cloud
cluster operator slowly upgrades a single Redpanda broker at a time, and always
waits for the health of the cluster to return to its nominal state before
continuing with the next broker upgrade, until all brokers are fully rolled out.
