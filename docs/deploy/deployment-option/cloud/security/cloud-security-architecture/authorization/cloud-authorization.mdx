There are two types of authorization in Redpanda Cloud:

- User authorizations

  User authorizations are managed by ACLs, and grant users permission to
  perform specific types of operations on specific resources (such as topics,
  groups, clusters, or transactional IDs).

  For a detailed description of ACL terminology, commands, and guidance on
  how to manage users with ACLs, refer to [ACLs](../../../../../../../manage/security/authorization#acls).

- Agent authorizations

  When deploying an [agent](../../../../cloud-overview#agent) as part of BYOC cluster
  provisioning, Redpanda Cloud automatically assigns IAM policies to that agent.
  The IAM policy permissions granted to the agent provide it the authorization
  required to enable Redpanda brokers to access AWS and GCP clusters.

  :::important
  There are no explicit user actions associated with IAM policies. Nor do IAM
  policies apply or act as deployment permissions. Rather, IAM policy
  permissions apply to Redpanda Cloud agents _only_, and serve to provide Redpanda
  agent access to AWS and GCP clusters so that Redpanda brokers can communicate
  with them.
