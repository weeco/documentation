Redpanda continuously performs chaos testing on Redpanda releases to check for
data inconsistency, liveness, and availability issues during adverse events, such
as losing brokers, network partition or packet drops, or approaching the limits
of the system in terms of disk, CPU, network, or memory utilization.

Redpanda has also undergone [Jepsen validation and testing](https://jepsen.io/analyses/redpanda-21.10.1).
Refer to this [blog](https://redpanda.com/blog/redpanda-official-jepsen-report-and-analysis)
for a detailed analysis of the findings.
