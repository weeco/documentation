Safety, reliability, and security are a top priority at Redpanda and an important
part of the Redanda product development lifecycle. Redpanda continuously performs
chaos testing on Redpanda Cloud releases to check for data inconsistency, liveness,
and availability issues during adverse events, which could be: losing brokers,
network partition or packet drops, or approaching the limits of the system in
terms of disk, CPU, network, or memory utilization.

## Auditing and testing

To test and ensure Redpanda Cloud adheres to consistency guarantees, Redpanda has
also undergone [Jepsen validation and testing](https://jepsen.io/analyses/redpanda-21.10.1).

Additionally, the Redpanda Cloud, SRE, and Security teams run periodic game day
testing, which simulates a failure or event to test systems, processes, and team
responses. This game day testing of Redpanda Cloud is designed to verify safety,
reliability, observability, and security of features, and to identify any regressions
or new gaps in the system, mental models, alerts, or runbooks. The Redpanda Cloud
cluster infrastructure is periodically reconciled to prevent state drift from
building up and causing incidents.

## Packaging

Redpanda Cloud cluster software artifacts (also known as the meta-package
or Install Pack) are packaged  and tested together with each Redpanda Cloud release.
Install Packs undergo a comprehensive certification process involving several types
of testing run on each cloud provider that Redpanda Cloud supports, and also includes
the testing of upgrades from the latest 2 Install Pack minor versions.

One output of the Install Pack certification process is a Redpanda configuration
for different limits and quotas, tailored to each supported cloud provider,
machine, and storage type. These limits and quotas can help users to configure some
of Redpandaâ€™s back pressure mechanisms.

# Self-regulation

Redpanda Cloud adheres to a system automatic self-regulation, as demonstrated with
its [Tiered Storage](../../../../../../manage/tiered-storage) and automated
[Cluster Balancing](../../../../../../manage/cluster-maintenance/cluster-balancing)
feature functionality.
