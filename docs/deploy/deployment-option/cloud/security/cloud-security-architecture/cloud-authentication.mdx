Redpanda Cloud ensures the highest level of authentication for both users and services.

## User authentication

Redpanda Cloud authenticates users directly using their email and password.
Passwords are hashed, salted, and encrypted at rest using [bcrypt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcrypt),
a password-hashing algorithm.

## Service authentication

The Redpanda Cloud data plane runs its own dedicated data plane agent,
which authenticates and connects against the control plane over a single TLS 1.2
encrypted TCP connection.

Redpanda Cloud enables [SASL/SCRAM authentication](../../../../../../manage/security/authentication#saslscram)
over TLS 1.2 to authenticate Kafka clients connecting to Redpanda clusters over
the TCP endpoint or listener.

When connecting through Redpandaâ€™s HTTP Proxy, authentication is done through an HTTP Basic Authentication header sent encrypted over TLS 1.2


The following features use AWS and GCP [IAM Policies](../cloud-authorization#iam-policies) to generate
dynamic and short-lived credentials to interact with cloud provider APIs:

- Data plane agent
- Tiered Storage
- Redpanda Console
- Managed connectors

AWS and GCP IAM policies have constrained permissions so that each service can only
access or manage its own data plane-scoped resources, following the principle of
least privilege.
