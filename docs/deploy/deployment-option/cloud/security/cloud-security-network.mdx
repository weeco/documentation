Redpanda Cloud deploys two different types of networks: one for private and another
for public Redpanda clusters. By default, networks are always laid out across
multiple availability zones (AZ) to enable the creation of one or many single
and multi-AZ Redpanda clusters within them.

## Public Redpanda clusters

Public Redpanda clusters are designed with the following:

- There is no network segmentation
- Redpanda brokers are collocated in the same subnets as the data plane agent.
- Redpanda TCP listeners are protected by SASL/SCRAM (SCRAM-SHA-256, SCRAM-SHA-512)
  authentication and encrypted in transit using TLS 1.2.

## Private Redpanda clusters

Private Redpanda clusters are designed with the following:

- Proper network segmentation
- All Redpanda services are only accessible from within the same VPC or through
  VPC peerings.
- The data plane agent is placed in public subnets and segmented away by
  firewall rules from Redpanda services.
