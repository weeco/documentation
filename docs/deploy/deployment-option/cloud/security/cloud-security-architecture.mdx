Redpanda cloud is designed to provide the most stringent security compliance and
privacy support for cloud customers. The topics in this section describe how the
Redpanda cloud security architecture is designed to ensure the protection of
customer data.

## Authentication

Redpanda Cloud provides manual authentication options, authentication
services, and SASL/SCRAM authentication.

### Authenticate manually

Redpanda Cloud supports federated authentication, commonly known as single sign-
on (SSO), using OAuth2 or OpenIDConnect (OIDC)-compatible identity providers. For
OIDC and OAuth2 token exchanges, Redpanda Cloud uses
[OAuth2’s authorization code](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6749#section-4.1)
flow and [Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE)](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7636).
Additionally, access tokens never leave your network or any user’s browser, and
are always encrypted at rest using AES-256 GCM.

When not using federated authentication, Redpanda Cloud authenticates users
directly using their email and password. Passwords are hashed, salted, and
encrypted at rest using the bcrypt password-hashing function.

### Authenticate using services

Redpanda Cloud data planes run their own dedicated data plane agent, which
authenticates and connects against the control plane over a single TLS 1.2
encrypted TCP connection. The authentication token is unique per Redpanda Cloud
cluster. For details about secret management practices, refer to Secrets.

AWS and GCP IAM roles are always used to generate dynamic and short-lived
credentials for the following to interact with cloud provider APIs:

* Data plane agent
* Redpanda’s Shadow Indexing process
* Redpanda Console
* Connectors

These roles have constrained permissions to ensure that each service can only
access or manage its own data plane-scoped resources following the principle of
least privilege.

## Authorization

All Redpanda Cloud clusters use IAM roles to retrieve dynamic credentials and
access S3 or GCS to push and pull Redpanda segments. The IAM role and policies
are fully managed by the data plane agent.
