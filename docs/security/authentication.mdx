Redpanda supports multiple forms of authentication including SASL/SCRAM, mTLS with principal mapping, and mixed-mode with multiple listeners. You can configure multiple listeners with `redpanda.yaml`, and with each listener, you can configure `authentication_method` and optionally TLS or mTLS. The guidelines put in place by your organization determine the type of authentication that you use. See [Configuring Listeners](/docs/cluster-administration/listener-configuration).

## Enable Authentication

To enable authentication, set `kafka_enable_authorization` to `true`, and specify at least one value for the `superusers` property. This user is used to bootstrap permissions for other users in the cluster. See [Cluster configuration properties](/docs/cluster-administration/cluster-property-configuration).

To update the `kafka_enable_authorization` property, run:

```bash
rpk cluster config set kafka_enable_authorization true
```
You can edit the superusers similarly. Redpanda recommends that you use the edit command to apply the new value:

```bash
rpk cluster config edit
```

To specify superusers using the `set` command, run:
```bash
rpk cluster config set superusers ['admin']
```

### Create superusers

When you configure authentication, you include one or more superusers in the Redpanda configuration file. This user has [ALL permissions](/docs/security/authorization#operations) on the cluster and grants permissions to new users. Without a superuser, you can create other users, but you can't grant them permissions to the cluster.

You can specify the name of the superuser. For example, if you used superuser `admin`, Redpanda allows the `admin` user to do anything, but Redpanda does not create the `admin` user. To create this superuser, run: 

```bash
rpk acl user create <super_user_username> -p <super_user_password> 
```

You can specify another existing user or a user that does not exist yet. Adding the user name in the configuration file does not create the user, but when you create a user with the user name specified in the configuration file, that user has full access to the cluster. You can then use that superuser to grant permissions to other users. 

The Admin API defaults to `localhost:9644`. If you've configured the Admin API to use a different address/port, use the `--api-urls <address:port>` flag.

Creating ACLs for users uses the Kafka protocol (default of `localhost:9092`). Because no ACLs exist at the start, you need a superuser to bypass the requirement of needing ACLs to create ACLs.

To create users and set passwords, run:

```bash
rpk acl user create admin \
-p <password> \
--api-urls localhost:9644
```

For information about using `rpk` to manage ACL users, see [rpk acl](/docs/reference/rpk-commands#rpk-acl). 

As a security best practice, you don't want to use the superuser to interact with the cluster, but you also don't want to delete the superuser (in case you need to grant permissions to new users later on). In addition, when you create the superuser, you specify a password for the user, which adds a level of security to the superuser. If you delete the user, someone else might re-create the user with a different password. 

## SASL/SCRAM

Simple Authentication Security Layer (SASL) is an authentication framework that lets the user choose the authentication mechanism. Redpanda supports the Salted Challenge Response Authentication Mechanism (SCRAM) authentication method.

:::note
SASL authentication is only available for the Kafka API.
:::

SASL provides authentication, but not encryption. You can, however, configure TLS to only handle encryption, and use SASL for authentication. This is useful if you require flexibility in the authorization mechanisms that you use.

SCRAM provides strong encryption for user names and passwords by default and does not require an external data store for user information. Redpanda supports the following SASL mechanisms: 

* `SCRAM-SHA-256`
* `SCRAM-SHA-512`

When you run a command with SASL authentication, you must include the mechanism with the following flag: 

```yaml
--sasl-mechanism <mechanism>
```

For example, to use the `SCRAM-SHA-256` mechanism, run: 

```bash
rpk topic create littlefoot \
--user panda \
--password pandaPassword \
--sasl-mechanism SCRAM-SHA-256
```

### Configure SASL authentication

To configure SASL authentication for the Kafka API, set `authentication_method` of the listener to `sasl`. 

In `redpanda.yaml`, enter: 

```yaml
redpanda:
  kafka_api:
    - address: 0.0.0.0
      port: 9092
      name: sasl_listener
// highlight-start
      authentication_method: sasl
// highlight-end
```

### Enable SASL with TLS encryption 

To enable SASL authentication with TLS encryption for the Kafka API, in `redpanda.yaml`, enter: 

```yaml
redpanda:
  kafka_api:
    - address: 0.0.0.0
      port: 9092
// highlight-start
      name: sasl_tls_listener
      authentication_method: sasl
// highlight-end
  kafka_api_tls:
// highlight-start
    - name: sasl_tls_listener
      key_file: server.key
      cert_file: server.crt
      truststore_file: ca.crt
      enabled: true
      require_client_auth: false
// highlight-end
```

### Connect to Redpanda

You can use the newly-created user to interact with Redpanda with `rpk`:

```bash
rpk topic describe test-topic \
--user admin \
--password <password> \
--sasl-mechanism SCRAM-SHA-256 \
--brokers localhost:9092
```

```bash
SUMMARY
=======
NAME        test-topic
PARTITIONS  1
REPLICAS    1

CONFIGS
=======
KEY                     VALUE       SOURCE
cleanup.policy          delete      DYNAMIC_TOPIC_CONFIG
compression.type        producer    DEFAULT_CONFIG
message.timestamp.type  CreateTime  DEFAULT_CONFIG
...
```

## Configure mTLS with authentication  

For mTLS authentication, Redpanda uses configurable rules to extract the principal from the Distinguished Name (DN) of an mTLS (X.509) certificate. It uses the principal as the identity or user name.

To enable mTLS authentication, set the `authentication_method` of the listener to `mtls_identity`. 

In `redpanda.yaml`, enter:

```yaml
redpanda:
  kafka_api:
    - address: 0.0.0.0
      port: 9092
// highlight-start
      name: mtls_listener
      authentication_method: mtls_identity
// highlight-end
  kafka_api_tls:
// highlight-start
    - name: mtls_listener
// highlight-end
      key_file: mtls_server.key
      cert_file: mtls_server.crt
      truststore_file: mtls_ca.crt
// highlight-start
      enabled: true
      require_client_auth: true
// highlight-end
```

By default, Redpanda matches the entire DN. To override the default, specify `kafka_mtls_principal_mapping_rules`. This is a list of rules that provide a mapping from DN to principal. Each rule has the following format: `RULE:pattern/replacement/[LU]`. Where:
 
*  `pattern` is a regular expression. For example, to extract the CN field: `.*CN=([^,]).*`   
* `replace` is used to adjust the match. For example, to use just the first match, use: `$1`.     
* `L` makes the match lowercase (optional)
* `U` makes the match uppercase (optional)

For example, assume a DN: `CN=www.redpanda.com,O=Redpanda,OU=Engineering,L=London,S=England,C=UK`

| Rule             | Principal   |
| --------         | ------    |   
| `RULE:.*CN=([^,]).*/$1/`        | `www.redpanda.com`    |
| `RULE:.*O=([^,]).*/$1/`         | `Redpanda`    |
| `RULE:.*O=([^,]).*/$1/L`        | `redpanda`    |
| `RULE:.*O=([^,]),OU=([^,]),.*,C=([^,])/$1-$2-$3/L`         | `redpanda-engineering-uk`    |
| `DEFAULT`        | `CN=www.redpanda.com,O=Redpanda,OU=Engineering,L=London,S=England,C=UK`    |

The first rule that matches is used to extract a principal.

To update the `kafka_mtls_principal_mapping_rules` property, run:

```bash
rpk cluster config set kafka_mtls_principal_mapping_rules '["DEFAULT"]'
```

## Securely bootstrap a cluster

The `RP_BOOTSTRAP_USER` environment variable creates an initial user account. This lets you bootstrap a cluster that is fully secure from the start.

When you set up Redpanda with `admin_api_require_auth` set to `true`, you can use `RP_BOOTSTRAP_USER` to create a user with a superuser password. This environment variable is only read when Redpanda starts up for the first time. Later modifications of its value have no affect. The value should have the format `<user>:<password>`.

## Disable authentication

To disable authentication for a listener, set `authentication_method` to `none`. If authorization is enabled, connections to this listener use the anonymous user.
