1. Download the `rpk` archive for Linux, and make sure the version matches your Redpanda version.

    * To download the latest version of `rpk`:

      ```bash
      curl -LO https://github.com/redpanda-data/redpanda/releases/latest/download/rpk-linux-amd64.zip
      ```

    * To download a version other than the latest:

      ```bash
      curl -LO https://github.com/redpanda-data/redpanda/releases/download/v<version>/rpk-linux-amd64.zip
      ```

1. Ensure that you have the folder `~/.local/bin`:

  ```bash
  mkdir -p ~/.local/bin
  ```

1. Add it to your `$PATH`:

  ```bash
  export PATH="~/.local/bin:$PATH"
  ```

1. Unzip the `rpk` files to your `~/.local/bin/` directory:

  ```bash
  unzip rpk-linux-amd64.zip -d ~/.local/bin/
  ```
