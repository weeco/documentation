While maximizing the rate of messages moving from producers to brokers then to consumers depends on tuning each of those components, the total throughput of all topics provides a system-level metric to monitor. When you observe abnormal, unhealthy spikes or dips in producer or consumer throughput, look for correlation with changes in the number of active connections (<Link to={props.frontmatter && props.frontmatter.linkRoot + 'reference/public-metrics-reference#redpanda_rpc_active_connections'}>`redpanda_rpc_active_connections`</Link>) and logged errors to drill down to the root cause.

The total throughput of a cluster can be measured by the producer and consumer rates across all topics.

To observe the total producer and consumer rates of a cluster, monitor <Link to={props.frontmatter && props.frontmatter.linkRoot + 'reference/public-metrics-reference#redpanda_kafka_request_bytes_total'}>`redpanda_kafka_request_bytes_total`</Link> with the `produce` and `consume` labels, respectively. 

#### Producer throughput

For the produce rate, create a query to get the produce rate across all topics:

```
sum(rate(redpanda_kafka_request_bytes_total{redpanda_request="produce"} [5m] )) by (redpanda_request)
```

#### Consumer throughput

For the consume rate, create a query to get the total consume rate across all topics:

```
sum(rate(redpanda_kafka_request_bytes_total{redpanda_request="consume"} [5m] )) by (redpanda_request)
```
