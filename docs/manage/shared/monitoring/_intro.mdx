Redpanda exports metrics through Prometheus endpoints for you to monitor system health and optimize system performance.

A Redpanda broker exports public metrics from the <Link to={props.frontmatter && props.frontmatter.linkRoot + 'reference/public-metrics-reference'}>`/public_metrics`</Link> endpoint through the Admin API port (default: 9644).

Before v22.2, a Redpanda broker provided metrics only through the <Link to={props.frontmatter && props.frontmatter.linkRoot + 'reference/internal-metrics-reference'}>`/metrics`</Link> endpoint through the Admin API port. While Redpanda still provides this endpoint, it includes many internal metrics that are unnecessary for a typical Redpanda user to monitor. Consequently, the `/public_metrics` endpoint was added to provide a smaller set of important metrics that can be queried and ingested more quickly and inexpensively. The `/metrics` endpoint is now referred to as the 'internal metrics' endpoint, and Redpanda recommends that you use it for development, testing, and analysis.

:::note
To maximize monitoring performance by minimizing the cardinality of data, some metrics are exported when their underlying features are in use, and are not exported when not in use. For example, a metric for consumer groups, <Link to={props.frontmatter && props.frontmatter.linkRoot + 'reference/public-metrics-reference#redpanda_kafka_consumer_group_committed_offset'}>`redpanda_kafka_consumer_group_committed_offset`</Link>, is not exported when no groups are registered.

When monitoring internal metrics, consider enabling <Link to={props.frontmatter && props.frontmatter.linkRoot + 'reference/cluster-properties#aggregate_metrics'}>aggregate_metrics</Link> to reduce the cardinality of data to monitor.
