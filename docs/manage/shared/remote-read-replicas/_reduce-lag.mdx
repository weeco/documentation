When object storage is enabled on a topic, Redpanda copies closed log segments to the configured object store. Log segments are closed when the value of the segment size has been reached. A topic’s object store thus lags behind the local copy by the <TunableClusterProperty name="log_segment_size" frontmatter={props.frontmatter}/> or, if set, by the topic's `segment.bytes` value. To reduce this lag in the data availability for the Remote Read Replica:

- You can lower the value of `segment.bytes`. This lets Redpanda archive smaller log segments more frequently, at the cost of increasing I/O and file count. 
- Self-hosted implementations running version 22.3 or higher can set an idle timeout with <TunableClusterProperty name="cloud_storage_segment_max_upload_interval_sec" frontmatter={props.frontmatter}/> to force Redpanda to periodically archive the contents of open log segments to object storage. This is useful if a topic’s write rate is low and log segments are kept open for long periods of time. The appropriate interval may depend on your total partition count: a system with less partitions can handle a higher number of segments per partition.
