When you create a topic, you can use remote recovery to download the topic data from object storage. You can also use remote recovery to restore a topic that was deleted from a cluster.

:::caution
Remote recovery is not intended to be a fully-functional disaster recovery solution. It is only safe when no other clusters are still writing to the specified bucket or container. Recovery does not provide snapshot-style consistency: some partitions in some topics will be more up to date than others. For example, restoring a consumer offsets topic could have offsets that point ahead of the restored data.

To create a new topic using remote recovery:

```bash
rpk topic create <topic_name> -c redpanda.remote.recovery=true
```

To create a new topic using remote recovery and enable Tiered Storage on the new topic with the `redpanda.remote.write` and `redpanda.remote.read` flags:

```bash
rpk topic create <topic_name> -c redpanda.remote.recovery=true -c redpanda.remote.write=true -c redpanda.remote.read=true
```
