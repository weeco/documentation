Reconciliation is a Redpanda process that monitors partitions and decides which partitions are uploaded on each broker to guarantee that data is uploaded only once. It runs periodically on every broker. It also balances the workload evenly between brokers. 

:::note
The broker uploading to object storage is always with the partition leader. Therefore, when partition leadership balancing occurs, Redpanda stops uploads to object storage from one broker and starts uploads on another broker.
