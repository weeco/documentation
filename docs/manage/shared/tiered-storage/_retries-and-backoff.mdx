If the object storage provider replies with an error message that the server is busy, Redpanda retries the request. Redpanda may retry on other errors, depending on the object storage provider. 

Redpanda always uses exponential backoff with cloud connections. You can configure the <TunableClusterProperty name="cloud_storage_initial_backoff_ms" frontmatter={props.frontmatter}/> property to set the time used as an initial backoff interval in the exponential backoff algorithm to handle an error. Default is 100 ms.
