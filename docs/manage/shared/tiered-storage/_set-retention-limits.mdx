Redpanda supports retention limits and compaction for topics using Tiered Storage. Set retention limits to purge topic data after it reaches a specified age or size.

Starting in Redpanda version 22.3, object storage is the default storage tier for all streaming data, and retention properties work the same for Tiered Storage topics and local storage topics. Data is retained in object storage until it reaches the configured time or size limit. 

Data expires from object storage following `retention.ms` or `retention.bytes`. For example, if `retention.bytes` is set to 10 GiB, then every partition in the topic has a limit of 10 GiB storage in object storage. When `retention.bytes` is exceeded by data in S3, the data in S3 is trimmed. If neither `retention.ms` nor `retention.bytes` are specified, then cluster level defaults are used.

During upgrade, Redpanda preserves retention settings for existing topics.

#### Manage local capacity for Tiered Storage topics

You can use topic-level properties to control retention of topic data in local storage. Settings can depend on the size of your drive, how many partitions you have, and how much data you keep for each partition.

With Tiered Storage enabled, data in local storage expires after `retention.local.target.ms` or `retention.local.target.bytes`. These settings are equivalent to `retention.ms` and `retention.bytes` without Tiered Storage.

When set, Redpanda keeps actively-used and sequential (next segment) data in local cache and targets to maintain this age of data in local storage. It purges data based on actual available local volume space, without forcing disk full situations when there is data skew. 

At topic creation with Tiered Storage enabled:
- If `retention.ms` or `retention.bytes` is set, it initializes the `remote_retention_` properties in `topic_properties`.
- If `retention.local.target.ms` or `retention.local.target.bytes` is set, it is normalized and used to initialize the retention fields in `topic_properties`.
- If properties are not specified:
  - Starting in version 22.3, new topics use the default retention values of 1 (local) and 7 days (cloud).
  - Upgraded topics retain their historical defaults of infinite retention.

After topic configuration, if Tiered Storage was disabled and must be enabled, or was enabled and must be disabled, Redpanda uses the local retention properties from the `topic_properties`.

#### Compacted topics in Tiered Storage

To save space, Redpanda compacts segments after they have been uploaded to object storage. Redpanda initially uploads all (non-compacted) segments. It then reuploads the segments with compaction applied.
