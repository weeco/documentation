Tiered Storage helps to lower storage costs by offloading log segments to object storage. You can specify the amount of storage you want to retain in local storage. You don't need to specify which log segments you want to move, because Redpanda moves them automatically based on cluster-level configuration properties. Tiered Storage indexes where data is offloaded, so it can look up the data when you need it.

The following image illustrates the Tiered Storage architecture: remote write uploads data from Redpanda to object storage, and remote read fetches data from object storage to Redpanda.
