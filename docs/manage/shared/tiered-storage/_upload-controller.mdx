Remote write uses a proportional derivative (PD) controller to minimize the backlog size for the write. The backlog consists of data that has not been uploaded to object storage but must be uploaded eventually. 

The upload controller prevents Redpanda from running out of disk space. If `remote.write` is set to `true`, Redpanda cannot evict log segments that have not been uploaded to object storage. If the remote write process cannot keep up with the amount of data that needs to be uploaded to object storage, the upload controller increases priority for the upload process. The upload controller measures the size of the upload periodically and tunes the priority of the remote write process.
