Data archiving requires a Tiered Storage configuration.

1. [Set up Tiered Storage](../tiered-storage#set-up-tiered-storage) for the cluster or for specific topics.

1. If you want to read data from object storage, [enable remote read](../tiered-storage#remote-read). When remote read is disabled, data can only be read from local storage. 

2. [Set retention limits](../tiered-storage#set-retention-limits).
   
To recover a topic from object storage, use [remote recovery](../tiered-storage#remote-recovery).
