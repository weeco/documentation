By default, Redpanda data is sent unencrypted. A security best practice is to enable encryption with TLS or mTLS. 

- Transport Layer Security (TLS), previously SSL, provides encryption for client-server communication. A server certificate prevents third parties from accessing data transferred between the client and server.
- mTLS, or 2-way TLS, is a protocol that authenticates both the server and the client. In addition to the server certificate required in TLS, mTLS also requires the client to give a certificate. This involves more overhead to implement, but it can be useful for environments that require additional security and only have a small number of verified clients.

For each Redpanda broker, specify the key file (`broker.key`), the certificate file (`broker.crt`), and the truststore file (`ca.crt`). Each broker has its own `broker.key` and `broker.crt`, but all brokers can have the same `ca.crt`.

## Prerequisites

TLS certificates are necessary for encryption. You can use your own certificates, either self-signed or issued by a trusted certificate authority (CA).

### Create certificate signing requests

This step creates the certificate signing request for the CA to extend trust over the broker's certificates.

#### 1. Create broker configuration file (broker.cnf)

A subject alternative name (SAN) indicates all of the domain names and IP addresses that are secured by the certificate. Depending on the address the client uses to connect to Redpanda, you might need to create a CNF file for each broker to modify the `alt_names` section with organizational details. For production usage, edit `alt_names` with DNS resolutions and/or the IP addresses.

```bash  title="broker.cnf"
[ req ]
prompt = no
distinguished_name = distinguished_name
req_extensions     = extensions

[ distinguished_name ]
organizationName = Redpanda

[ extensions ]
keyUsage         = critical,digitalSignature,keyEncipherment
extendedKeyUsage = serverAuth,clientAuth
subjectAltName   = @alt_names

[ alt_names ]
DNS.1 = localhost
DNS.2 = redpanda
DNS.3 = console
DNS.4 = connect
IP.1  = 127.0.0.1
```

You could configure alternative names with a single version of `broker.key`/`broker.crt`, as long as you update the certificate for all brokers in the cluster any time you edit an entry. For example:

```bash
[ alt_names ]
DNS.1 = broker1.example.com
DNS.2 = broker2.example.com
DNS.3 = broker3.example.com
```

#### 2. Generate broker private key (broker.key)

Generate a 2048-bit RSA private key for brokers:

```bash
openssl genrsa -out broker.key 2048
```

where:

| Output              | Description   |
| --------            | ------    | 
| `-out broker.key`     | The public key certificate of the CA.    |  


#### 3. Create a certificate signing request (broker.csr)

Create a public certificate signing request (CSR) for the brokers:

```bash
openssl req -new -config broker.cnf -key broker.key -out broker.csr
```

where:

| Inputs              | Description   |
| --------            | ------    | 
| `-new`              | New request.    | 
| `-config broker.cnf`  | Configuration file to use when generating certificates (created above).    | 
| `-key broker.key`     | Private key of the broker (created above).    | 

| Output              | Description   |
| --------            | ------    | 
| `-out broker.csr`     | The public key certificate of the CA.    |  

If generated by a corporate CA, these certificate signing requests must be signed with the following extensions:

```bash
keyUsage         = critical,digitalSignature,keyEncipherment
extendedKeyUsage = serverAuth,clientAuth
```

### Create a local CA for self-signed certificates

:::note
This step is required if you want to generate multiple certificates all signed by the same root; for example, you want to use mTLS but issue different certificates to multiple Redpanda brokers and clients.

To generate a self-signed certificate in a single command:

```bash
openssl req -new -newkey rsa:4096 -days 365 -nodes -x509 -keyout broker.key -out broker.crt -subj "/CN=redpanda" -addext "subjectAltName = DNS:localhost, IP: 127.0.0.1"
```
:::

#### 1. Create CA configuration file (ca.cnf)

Edit the `distinguished_name` section with your own organization details. For `default_md`, `sha256` is the minimum message digest level. The `subjectAltName` must be accurate for the broker's certificate.

```bash title="ca.cnf"
[ ca ]
default_ca = CA_default

[ CA_default ]
default_days    = 365
default_md      = sha256
unique_subject  = no

[ req ]
prompt = no
distinguished_name = distinguished_name
x509_extensions    = extensions

[ distinguished_name ]
organizationName = Redpanda
commonName       = Redpanda CA

[ extensions ]
keyUsage         = critical,digitalSignature,nonRepudiation,keyEncipherment,keyCertSign
basicConstraints = critical,CA:true,pathlen:1
subjectAltName   = @alt_names

[ alt_names ]
DNS.1 = localhost
IP.1 = 127.0.0.1

```

#### 2. Generate CA private key and public certificate

Create a CA key to self-sign certificates:

```bash
openssl genrsa -out ca.key 2048
chmod 400 ca.key
```

Create a public certificate for the CA:

```bash
openssl req -new -x509 -config ca.cnf -key ca.key -days 365 -batch -out ca.crt
```

where:

| Inputs              | Description   |
| --------            | ------    | 
| `-new`              | New request.    | 
| `-x509`             | Create an X.509 certificate, instead of a certificate signing request (CSR).    | 
| `-config ca.cnf`    | Configuration file to use when generating certificates (created above).    | 
| `-key ca.key`       | Private key of the CA (created above).    | 
| `-days 365`         | Number of days signed certificates are valid.    | 
| `-batch`            | Batch mode, where certificates are certified automatically.     | 

| Output             | Description   |
| --------            | ------    | 
| `-out ca.crt`       | The public key certificate of the CA.    |   

#### 3. Sign certificates

Sign and generate an X.509 certificate for the Redpanda broker:

```bash
openssl x509 -req -signkey ca.key -days 365 -extfile broker.cnf -extensions extensions -in broker.csr -out broker.crt
```

where: 

| Inputs             | Description   |
| --------           | ------    | 
| `-req`               | Input is a certificate request. Sign and output.    | 
| `-signkey ca.key`    | Private key of the CA (created above).    | 
| `-days 365`          | Number of days signed certificates are valid.    | 
| `-extfile broker.cnf`  | Configuration file for CA.    | 
| `-extensions extensions` | Section in `broker.cnf` to use when applying extensions.    | 
| `-in broker.csr`       | Broker certificate signing request (CSR generated above).    | 

| Output             | Description   |
| --------            | ------    | 
| `-out broker.crt`     | The signed public key certificate for the broker.    |           

## Configure TLS

To configure TLS, in `redpanda.yaml`, enter:

```yaml title="redpanda.yaml"
redpanda:
// highlight-start
  rpc_server_tls: {}
// highlight-end
  kafka_api:
    - address: 0.0.0.0
      port: 9092
      name: tls_listener
// highlight-start
  kafka_api_tls:
    - name: tls_listener
      key_file: broker.key
      cert_file: broker.crt
      truststore_file: ca.crt
      enabled: true
      require_client_auth: false
// highlight-end
// highlight-start
  admin_api_tls: []
// highlight-end
pandaproxy:
// highlight-start
  pandaproxy_api_tls: []
// highlight-end
schema_registry:
// highlight-start
  schema_registry_api_tls: []
// highlight-end
```


To set the RPC port to encrypt replication, add:

```yaml title="redpanda.yaml"
redpanda:
// highlight-start
  rpc_server_tls:
    enabled: true
    require_client_auth: false
    key_file: broker.key
    cert_file: broker.crt
    truststore_file: ca.crt
// highlight-end
```

Schema Registry and HTTP Proxy connect to Redpanda over the Kafka API. If you configure a TLS listener for the Kafka API, you must add `schema_registry_client::broker_tls` and `pandaproxy_client::broker_tls`. All APIs, except the internal RPC port, support multiple listeners. See:
- [Configure Schema Registry and HTTP Proxy to connect to Redpanda with SASL](../authentication/#configure-schema-registry-and-http-proxy-to-connect-to-redpanda-with-sasl) 
- [Configure Listeners](../../security/listener-configuration)

## Configure mTLS 

To enable mTLS, add `require_client_auth` set to `true`. 

For example, for the Kafka API, in `redpanda.yaml`, enter: 

```yaml title="redpanda.yaml"
redpanda:
  kafka_api:
    - address: 0.0.0.0
      port: 9092
      name: mtls_listener
  kafka_api_tls:
    - name: mtls_listener
      key_file: mtls_broker.key
      cert_file: mtls_broker.crt
      truststore_file: mtls_ca.crt
      enabled: true
// highlight-start
      require_client_auth: true
// highlight-end
```

See also: [Configure Listeners](../../security/listener-configuration)

### Configure mTLS for a Kafka API listener

To enable mTLS for a Kafka API listener, edit `redpanda.yaml`:

```yaml title="redpanda.yaml"
redpanda:
  kafka_api:
// highlight-start
  - name: internal
// highlight-end
    address: 0.0.0.0
    port: 9092

  advertised_kafka_api:
  // highlight-start
  - name: internal
  // highlight-end
    address: <port-clients-connect-to>
    port: 9092

  kafka_api_tls:
// highlight-start
  - name: internal
    enabled: true
    require_client_auth: true
    cert_file: <path-to-PEM-formatted-cert-file>
    key_file: <path-to-PEM-formatted-key-file>
    truststore_file: <path-to-PEM-formatted-CA-file>
// highlight-end
```
:::note notes
- Remember to replace placeholders in brackets. 
- `kafka_api` is the listener declaration. This `name` can have any value.
- `advertised_kafka_api` is the advertised listener. This `name` should match the name of a declared listener. This `address` is the host name clients use to connect to the broker.
- `kafka_api_tls` is the listener's TLS configuration. This `name` must match the corresponding listener's name.

## Use rpk with TLS

If you're using `rpk` to interact with the Kafka API using mTLS identity (for example, to manage topics or messages), pass the `--tls-key`, `--tls-cert`, and `--tls-truststore` flags to authenticate.

To interact with the Admin API (for example, to manage users), pass the `--admin-api-tls-key`, `--admin-api-tls-cert`, and `--admin-api-tls-truststore` flags.

```bash
 rpk topic create test-topic \
--tls-key <path-to-PEM-formatted-key-file> \
--tls-cert <path-to-PEM-formatted-cert-file> \
--tls-truststore <path-to-PEM-formatted-CA-file>
```

:::note
Remember to replace placeholders in brackets.  
:::

<details>
  <summary>
  Example output
  </summary>

  ```bash
  TOPIC       STATUS
  test-topic  OK
  ```
  </details>

To check the configuration of the topic, run:

```bash
rpk topic describe test-topic <tls-flags-from-above>
```

By default, `rpk` connects to `localhost:9092` for Kafka protocol commands. If you're connecting to a remote broker or if you configured your local broker differently, use the `--brokers <address:port>` flag.
