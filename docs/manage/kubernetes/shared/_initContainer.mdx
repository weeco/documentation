Pods that run Redpanda brokers must have read/write access to their data directories. The initContainer is responsible for setting write permissions on the data directories. By default, `statefulset.initContainers.setDataDirOwnership` is disabled because most storage drivers call `SetVolumeOwnership` to give Redpanda permissions to the root of the storage mount. However, some storage drivers, such as `hostPath`, do not call `SetVolumeOwnership`. In this case, you must enable the initContainer to set the permissions.

:::info
To set permissions on the data directories, the initContainer must run as root. However, be aware that an initContainer running as root can introduce the following security risks:

- **Privilege escalation:** If attackers gains access to the initContainer, they can escalate privileges to gain full control over the system. For example, attackers could use the initContainer to gain unauthorized access to sensitive data, tamper with the system, or start denial-of-service attacks.
- **Container breakouts:** If the container is misconfigured or the container runtime has a vulnerability, attackers could escape from the initContainer and access the host operating system.
- **Image tampering:** If attackers gain access to the container image of the initContainer, they could add malicious code or backdoors to it. Image tampering could compromise the security of the entire cluster.
