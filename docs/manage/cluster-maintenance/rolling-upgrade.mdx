To benefit from Redpanda's new features and enhancements, upgrade to the latest version. Redpanda recommends that you perform a rolling upgrade on production clusters, which requires all brokers to be placed into maintenance mode and restarted separately, one after the other. 

Redpanda version numbers follow the convention AB.C.D, where AB is the two digit year, C is the feature release, and D is the patch release. For example, version 22.3.1 indicates the first patch release on the third feature release of the year 2022. 

:::important
- New features are enabled after all brokers (nodes) in the cluster are upgraded. You can stop the upgrade process and roll back to the original version as long as you have not upgraded every broker and restarted the cluster.
- Redpanda only supports upgrading one sequential feature release at a time. For example, you can upgrade from the 22.2 feature release to 22.3. You cannot skip feature releases. 
- Redpanda only supports downgrading between sequential patch releases. For example, you can downgrade from the 22.2.2 patch release to 22.2.1, but you cannot downgrade to 22.1.7.
:::

## Prerequisites

- A running Redpanda cluster.
- [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/download/) for listing available versions.
- An understanding of the [impact of broker restarts](#impact-of-broker-restarts) on clients, node CPU, and any alerting systems you use.

## Find a new version

Before you upgrade, find out which Redpanda version you are currently running, whether you can upgrade straight to the new version, and what's changed since your original version. To find your current version, run: 

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="check-linux" label="Linux" default>

```bash
rpk redpanda admin brokers list
```

For all available flags, see the [`rpk redpanda admin brokers list` command reference](../../../reference/rpk/rpk-redpanda/rpk-redpanda-admin-brokers-list).

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="check-docker" label="Docker" default>

:::caution
Running Redpanda directly on Docker is not supported for production usage. This platform should only be used for testing.
:::

```bash
docker exec -it <container_name><container_tag> rpk version 
```

Remember to replace the variables `<container_name>` and `<container_tag>`. The container tag determines which version of `rpk` to use. The release process bundles `rpk` and `Redpanda` into the same container tag with the same version. 

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="check-macos" label="macOS" default>

```bash
brew list --versions | grep redpanda
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>


<details>
<summary>
Example output
</summary>

```bash
v22.3.11 (rev 9eefb90)

```

</details>

:::note
If your current version is more than one feature release behind the latest Redpanda version, you must first upgrade to an intermediate version. To list all available versions:

```bash
curl -s 'https://hub.docker.com/v2/repositories/redpandadata/redpanda/tags/?ordering=last_updated&page=1&page_size=50' | jq -r '.results[].name'
```

Check the [release notes](https://github.com/redpanda-data/redpanda/releases) to find information about what has changed between Redpanda versions.

## Impact of broker restarts

<ImpactOfRestarts/>

## Perform a rolling upgrade

A rolling upgrade involves putting a broker into [maintenance mode](../../node-management), upgrading the broker, taking the broker out of maintenance mode, and then repeating the process on the next broker in the cluster. Placing brokers into maintenance mode ensures a smooth upgrade of your cluster while reducing the risk of interruption or degradation in service. 

When a broker is placed into maintenance mode, it reassigns its partition leadership to other brokers for all topics that have a replication factor greater than one. Reassigning partition leadership involves _draining_ leadership from the broker and _transferring_ that leadership to another broker. If you have topics with `replication.factor=1`, and if you have sufficient disk space, Redpanda recommends temporarily increasing the replication factor. This can help limit outages for these topics during the rolling upgrade. Do this before the upgrade to make sure there's time for the data to replicate to other brokers. For more information, see [Change topic replication factor](../../data-migration/#change-topic-replication-factor). 

To ensure that all brokers are active before upgrading, run:

```bash 
rpk redpanda admin brokers list
```

All brokers should show `active` for `MEMBERSHIP-STATUS` and `true` for `IS-ALIVE`:

<details>
<summary>
Example output
</summary>

```
NODE-ID  NUM-CORES  MEMBERSHIP-STATUS  IS-ALIVE  BROKER-VERSION
0        1          active             true      v22.3.11
1        1          active             true      v22.3.11
2        1          active             true      v22.3.11
```

</details>

New features in a version are enabled after all brokers in the cluster are upgraded. If problems occur, the upgrade is not committed.

:::note
Redpanda started supporting [consumer offsets](../../../develop/consume-data/consumer-offsets) in version 22.1. When upgrading from version 21.11 to 22.1, after all brokers are upgraded, Redpanda starts to migrate consumer group topics to `__consumer_offsets`. This takes some time, depending on the data size. Until it finishes, all consumer group-related operations (consume, offset commit, coordinator election) are blocked. The migration to consumer offsets is complete when you see `consumer offset feature enabled` in all brokers.
:::

### Enable maintenance mode

1. Check that all brokers are healthy: 

    ```bash
    rpk cluster health
    ```

    <details>
    <summary>
    Expected output
    </summary>

    ```bash {3}
    CLUSTER HEALTH OVERVIEW
    =======================
    Healthy:                     true
    Controller ID:               0
    All nodes:                   [0 1 2]
    Nodes down:                  []
    Leaderless partitions:       []
    Under-replicated partitions: []
    ```

    </details>

2. Select a broker that has not been upgraded yet and place it into maintenance mode: 

    ```bash
    rpk cluster maintenance enable <node-id> --wait
    ```

    The --wait option tells the command to wait until a given broker, 0 in this example, finishes draining all partitions it originally served. After the partition draining completes, the command completes.

    <details>
    <summary>
    Expected output
    </summary>

    ```
    Successfully enabled maintenance mode for node 0
    Waiting for node to drain...
    NODE-ID  DRAINING  FINISHED  ERRORS  PARTITIONS  ELIGIBLE  TRANSFERRING  FAILED
    0        false     false     false   0           0         0             0
    0     false  false  false  0     0     0     0
    0     false  false  false  0     0     0     0
    0     false  false  false  0     0     0     0
    0     false  false  false  0     0     0     0
    0     false  false  false  0     0     0     0
    0     true  true  false  3     0     2     0

    ```

    </details>

3. Verify that the broker is in maintenance mode: 

    ```bash {2}
    rpk cluster maintenance status
    ```

    <details>
    <summary>
    Expected output
    </summary>

    ```bash {2}
    NODE-ID  DRAINING  FINISHED  ERRORS  PARTITIONS  ELIGIBLE  TRANSFERRING  FAILED
    0        true      true      false   3           0         2             0
    1        false     false     false   0           0         0             0
    2        false     false     false   0           0         0             0
    ```

    </details>

4. Validate again the health of the cluster:

    ```bash
    rpk cluster health
    ```

    <details>
    <summary>
    Expected output
    </summary>

    ```bash {3}
    CLUSTER HEALTH OVERVIEW
    =======================
    Healthy:                     true
    Controller ID:               0
    All nodes:                   [0 1 2]
    Nodes down:                  []
    Leaderless partitions:       []
    Under-replicated partitions: []
    ```

    </details>

    :::note
    You can also evaluate [external metrics](../../monitoring) to determine cluster health. If the cluster has any issues, take the broker out of maintenance mode by running the following command before proceeding with other operations, such as decommissioning or retrying the rolling upgrade:
    
    ```bash
    rpk cluster maintenance disable <node-id>
    ``` 
    
    :::

### Upgrade your version

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="upgrade-linux" label="Linux" default>

For Linux distributions, the process changes according to the distribution:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="fedora-redhat" label="Fedora/RedHat" default>

On the terminal, run:
```bash
sudo yum update redpanda
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="debian-ubuntu" label="Debian/Ubuntu">

On the terminal, run:
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install redpanda
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>


</TabItem>

<TabItem value="upgrade-docker" label="Docker" default>

:::caution
Running Redpanda directly on Docker is not supported for production usage. This platform should only be used for testing.
:::

To perform an upgrade you must replace the current image with a new one.

First, check which image is currently running on your Docker:

```bash
docker ps
```

Stop and remove Redpanda's container(s):

```bash
docker stop <container_id>
...
docker rm <container_id>
```

Remove current images:

```bash
docker rmi <image_id>
```

Pull the desired Redpanda's version, or adjust the setting to `latest` in the `version` tag:

```bash
docker pull docker.redpanda.com/redpandadata/redpanda:<version>
```

After it completes, restart the cluster:

```bash
docker restart <container_name>
```

For more information, see [Redpanda Quickstart for Docker](../../../get-started/quick-start/?quickstart=docker#prerequisites).

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="upgrade-macos" label="macOS" default>

If you previously installed Redpanda with brew, run:

```bash
brew upgrade redpanda-data/tap/redpanda
```

For installations from binary files, download the preferred version from the release list and then overwrite the current rpk file in the installed location.

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

### Check metrics

Check the following metrics before continuing with the upgrade:

| Metric | Description | 
| ---               | ---          
| [redpanda_kafka_under_replicated_replicas](../../../reference/public-metrics-reference/#redpanda_kafka_under_replicated_replicas) | If this shows any non-zero value, then replication cannot catch up, and the upgrade should be paused. |
| [redpanda_cluster_unavailable_partitions](../../../reference/public-metrics-reference/#redpanda_cluster_unavailable_partitions)  | Before restart, wait for this to show zero unavailable partitions.  |  
| [redpanda_kafka_request_bytes_total](../../../reference/public-metrics-reference/#redpanda_kafka_request_bytes_total)| Before restart, the produce and consume rate for each broker should recover to the pre-upgrade value. |
| [redpanda_kafka_request_latency_seconds](../../../reference/public-metrics-reference/#redpanda_kafka_request_latency_seconds) | Before restart, the p99 histogram should recover to the pre-upgrade value.    |   
| [redpanda_rpc_request_latency_seconds](../../../reference/public-metrics-reference/#redpanda_rpc_request_latency_seconds) | Before restart, the p99 histogram should recover to the pre-upgrade value.    | 
| [redpanda_cpu_busy_seconds_total](../../../reference/public-metrics-reference/#redpanda_cpu_busy_seconds_total) | Check the CPU utilization. The derivative gives you a 0.0-1.0 value for how much time the core was busy in a given second. |

### Restart broker

Restart the broker's Redpanda service with [`rpk redpanda stop`](../../../reference/rpk/rpk-redpanda/rpk-redpanda-stop), then [`rpk redpanda start`](../../../reference/rpk/rpk-redpanda/rpk-redpanda-start).

### Disable maintenance mode

After you've successfully upgraded the broker:

1. Take the broker out of maintenance mode: 

    ```bash
    rpk cluster maintenance disable <node-id>
    ```

    <details>
    <summary>
    Expected output
    </summary>

    ```bash
    Successfully disabled maintenance mode for node 0
    ```

    </details>

2. Ensure that the broker is no longer in maintenance mode:

    ```bash
    rpk cluster maintenance status
    ```
    <details>
    <summary>
    Expected output
    </summary>

    ```bash {2}
    NODE-ID  DRAINING  FINISHED  ERRORS  PARTITIONS  ELIGIBLE  TRANSFERRING  FAILED
    0        false     false     false   0           0         0             0
    1        false     false     false   0           0         0             0
    2        false     false     false   0           0         0             0
    ```

    </details>

### Post-upgrade tasks

To verify that the cluster is running properly, run:

```bash
rpk cluster health
```

To view additional information about your brokers, run:

```bash
rpk redpanda admin brokers list
```
