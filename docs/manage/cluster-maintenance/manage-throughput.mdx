## Node-wide throughput limits

The network bandwidth and disk utilization of cluster nodes may be overloaded by clients that produce or consume throughput without limits. To prevent resource overloading caused by unconstrained throughput and to configure back pressure, Redpanda provides runtime-configurable properties that limit and balance throughput of Kafka API traffic.

To manage the volume of traffic going through a node, Redpanda implements throughput quotas on the ingress and egress sides of every node. The throughput quota accounts for all Kafka API traffic going in or out of a node, with the value of quota representing the allowed rate of data passing through in one direction. When a connection is in breach of the quota, the throttler advises the client about the delay (throttle time) that would bring the rate back to the allowed level, and it implements that delay before handling Kafka API requests. To control the quotas, Redpanda provides configurable rate limits for total ingress and egress traffic through a node.

With Redpanda's [thread-per-core model](../../../get-started/architecture#thread-per-core-model), the Kafka API traffic to and from a client connection is processed by a single core (shard). In order to manage throughput quotas efficiently, node quotas are distributed between shards, and each per-shard quota is in turn shared by all connections served by the shard. Splitting node quota optimally between shards is done behind the scenes by the quota balancer component.

To distribute the node throughput quota, the balancer periodically monitors the throughput rate of a node's shards, and it distributes more quota to the shards that can make better use of it than the others. Each shard has a minimum throughput quota value, which is configurable both as a percentage of the default quota and as an absolute rate limit.

The properties for node-wide throughput quota balancing are configured at the cluster level, for all nodes in a cluster:

:::note notes

- By default, both `kafka_throughput_limit_node_in_bps` and `kafka_throughput_limit_node_out_bps` are disabled, no throughput limits are applied. You must manually set them to enable quota balancing with throughput limits.
- `kafka_quota_balancer_min_shard_throughput_bps` doesn't override the `kafka_throughput_limit_node_in_bps` and `kafka_throughput_limit_node_out_bps` limit settings. Consequently, the value of
  `kafka_throughput_limit_node_in_bps` or `kafka_throughput_limit_node_out_bps` can result in lesser throughput than `kafka_quota_balancer_min_shard_throughput_bps`.

## Client throughput limits

Similar to [node-wide throughput limits](#node-wide-throughput-limits) but for clients, Redpanda provides configurable throughput quotas that apply to an individual client or a group of clients. 

:::note
The client throughput quotas limit the rates within each shard of a Redpanda cluster's node. The quotas are neither shared nor balanced between shards and nodes.
:::

### Individual client throughput limit

To set throughput quota for a single client, configure the cluster properties [`target_quota_byte_rate`](../../../reference/cluster-properties#target_quota_byte_rate) and [`target_fetch_quota_byte_rate`](../../../reference/cluster-properties#target_fetch_quota_byte_rate).

- The `target_quota_byte_rate` property applies to a producer client that isn't a member of a client group configured by [`kafka_client_group_byte_rate_quota`](../../../reference/cluster-properties#kafka_client_group_byte_rate_quota). It sets the maximum throughput quota of a client sending to a Redpanda broker node.
- The `target_fetch_quota_byte_rate` property applies to a consumer client that isn't a member of a client group configured by [`kafka_client_group_fetch_byte_rate_quota`](../../../reference/cluster-properties#kafka_client_group_fetch_byte_rate_quota). It sets the maximum throughput quota of a client fetching from a Redpanda broker node.

The values of both `target_quota_byte_rate` and `target_fetch_quota_byte_rate` are throughput rate limits within a shard, in bytes per second.

### Group of clients throughput limit

To set throughput quota for a group of clients, configure the cluster properties [`kafka_client_group_byte_rate_quota`](../../../reference/cluster-properties#kafka_client_group_byte_rate_quota) and [`kafka_client_group_fetch_byte_rate_quota`](../../../reference/cluster-properties#kafka_client_group_fetch_byte_rate_quota).

- The `kafka_client_group_byte_rate_quota` property applies to producer clients. It sets a maximum throughput quota of traffic sent to Redpanda from each producer in the group named by the property. 
- The `kafka_client_group_fetch_byte_rate_quota` property applies to consumer clients. It sets a maximum throughput quota of traffic fetched from Redpanda by each consumer in the group named by the property. 

Both `kafka_client_group_byte_rate_quota` and `kafka_client_group_fetch_byte_rate_quota` have the configuration value fields: 

- `group_name`: a name for the group of clients.
- `clients_prefix`: a client belonging to the group has this prefix in its `client_id` property.
- `quota`: the maximum throughput rate of **each client in the group** in bytes per second.

:::note
For `kafka_client_group_fetch_byte_rate_quota`, a group of consumer clients is not a Kafka consumer group, and the `group_name` field is not a Kafka consumer group ID. Instead, it is the set of clients fetching from a Redpanda broker node that are configured by the property to be throughput limited.

An example configuration of `kafka_client_group_byte_rate_quota` for two groups of producers:

```
"kafka_client_group_byte_rate_quota": [
  {
      "group_name": "group_1",
      "clients_prefix": "producer_group_alone_producer",
      "quota": 10240
  },
  {
      "group_name": "group_2",
      "clients_prefix": "producer_group_multiple",
      "quota": 20480
  },
]
```
