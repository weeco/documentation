Redpanda Keeper `rpk` is Redpanda's command line interface (CLI) utility.

The `rpk` commands let you configure, manage, and tune Redpanda clusters. They also let you manage topics, groups, and access control lists (ACLs).

The `rpk` commands feature autocompletion, so you that can write the first few letters that uniquely identify a command and then use the tab key to complete it. For more information, see [rpk autocompletion documentation](../../rpk/rpk-generate/rpk-generate-shell-completion).
