This section provides details on how to enable mutual Transport Layer Security (mTLS) authentication on Kubernetes. mTLS authenticates the server and encrypts communication between the server and client, as one-way TLS does, and also authenticates the client. Redpanda supports mTLS authentication on all four APIs.

For general security information, see [Redpanda Security on Kubernetes](../security-kubernetes).


## Prerequisites

1. Configure the kubectl context.
2. Install cert-manager.
3. Install the Redpanda operator.

If you havenâ€™t completed these tasks, follow one of the Install Redpanda Guide for Kubernetes to get set up before you configure TLS. Just stop before you install and connect to the Redpanda cluster.

## Step 1: Create the cluster specification file

The Redpanda GitHub repository contains an `mtls.yaml` sample configuration file you can use to enable mTLS authentication: [redpanda-examples/docs/example-config/kubernetes/mtls.yaml](https://github.com/redpanda-data/redpanda-examples/blob/main/docs/example-config/kubernetes/mtls.yaml).

:::note
To modify the sample file, save it locally and make the required changes.
:::

The text below is the Redpanda `mtls.yaml` file with the relevant sections highlighted: 

```yaml
 apiVersion: redpanda.vectorized.io/v1alpha1
kind: Cluster
// highlight-start
metadata:
  name: cluster-sample-mtls
  // highlight-end
spec:
  image: "vectorized/redpanda"
  version: "latest"
  replicas: 1
  resources:
    requests:
      cpu: 1
      memory: 1.2G
    limits:
      cpu: 1
      memory: 1.2G
  configuration:
    rpcServer:
      port: 33145
      // highlight-start
    kafkaApi:
     - port: 9092
       tls:
         enabled: true
         requireClientAuth: true
    pandaproxyApi:
     - port: 8082
       tls:
         enabled: true
         requireClientAuth: true
    schemaRegistry:
       port: 8081
       tls:
         enabled: true
         requireClientAuth: true
    adminApi:
     - port: 9644
       tls:
         enabled: true
         requireClientAuth: true
         // highlight-end
     developerMode: true
```

Complete these steps to configure the cluster specification file. The steps reference the highlighted lines in the file:

1. Configure the cluster name. The following property in the file is the name of the cluster. Change this value to the name of your cluster:

```yaml
name: cluster-sample-mtls
```

2. Enable mTLS for each API individually. You can enable mTLS on one or more of the APIs. In the example, all four APIs have mTLS enabled:

```yaml
kafkaApi:
 - port: 9092
   tls:
     enabled: true
     requireClientAuth: true
pandaproxyApi:
 - port: 8082
   tls:
     enabled: true
     requireClientAuth: true
schemaRegistry:
   port: 8081
   tls:
     enabled: true
     requireClientAuth: true
adminApi:
 - port: 9644
   tls:
     enabled: true
     requireClientAuth: true
```

## Step 2: Configure external connectivity (optional)

The table below lists the supported listener configurations for each API with mTLS enabled. See [Listeners](../security-kubernetes#listeners).

| API              | Listener configurations with mTLS   |
| --------         | ------                             |
| Kafka API <br /> HTTP Proxy <br /> Admin API | <ul><li> One internal listener with mTLS enabled </li><li> One internal listener and one external listener. Only one of the listeners can have mTLS enabled. </li> </ul> |
| Schema Registry  | <ul><li> One internal listener with mTLS enabled </li><li> One listener that is used for internal and external connectivity with mTLS enabled </li> </ul>|

You can specify up to two listeners for each API, but only one listener can have mTLS enabled. If you do have two listeners, one must be internal, and one must be external. The exception is Schema Registry. The Schema Registry listener can be internal, or it can be an internal port that is used internally and externally. If you enable external connectivity on Schema Registry, the Kubernetes node port connects to the internal Redpanda port to provide external connectivity.

To enable external connectivity with mTLS, add the following lines to each API in the configuration file that you created in Step 1:

```yaml
 - external:
     enabled: true
     subdomain: <subdomain_name>
```

The `subdomain` field lets you specify the advertised address of the external listener. The subdomain addresses, including the brokers, must be registered with a DNS provider, such as [Amazon Route 53](https://aws.amazon.com/route53/). You only need to include the subdomain name in this field, not the brokers. Each API in the configuration file must have the same `subdomain` specified.

The external port is generated automatically, and you do not need to specify it. In the following example, mTLS is enabled on the external listener for the Kafka API. Enable external connectivity the same way for Admin API and HTTP Proxy.

```yaml
kafkaApi:
 - port: 9092
 - external:
     enabled: true
     subdomain: <subdomain_name>
   tls:
     enabled: true
     requireClientAuth: true
```

The Schema Registry syntax is slightly different, in that the ports are not a list. You can specify one internal port and one external port. Schema Registry always uses an internal port and with external connectivity configured, the Kubernetes node port connects to the internal Redpanda port. Configure mTLS with external connectivity for Schema Registry like this:

```yaml
schemaRegistry:
  port: 8081
  external:
    enabled: true
    subdomain: <subdomain_name>
  tls:
    enabled: true
    requireClientAuth: true
```

For information about external connectivity, including subdomains, see [External connectivity](../security-kubernetes#external-connectivity).

## Step 3: Provide an issuer or certificate (optional)

Kafka API and Schema Registry let you provide a certificate issuer or certificate for the node certificate.

When you enable mTLS, the Redpanda operator generates a root certificate for each API. The root certificate is local to the cluster and the operator uses the root certificate to generate leaf certificates for the nodes and the client. However, for Kafka API and Schema registry you can instead specify a certificate issuer or a certificate. 

For information about how certificates are created and used in Redpanda, see [Certificates](../security-kubernetes#certificates).

### Provide an issuer

To provide a certificate issuer, add the `issuerRef` property to the cluster specification file that you created in the previous step. For information about issuers, see the cert-manager [Issuer](https://cert-manager.io/docs/concepts/issuer/) documentation.

You can provide an issuer for `kafkaAPI` or `schemaRegistry` in the same way. The example here is the `kafkaAPI` configuration configuration with the `issuerRef` property highlighted: 

```yaml
kafkaApi:
 - port: 9092
   tls:
     enabled: true
          // highlight-start
     issuerRef: 
       name: <issuer_name>
       kind: <issuer>
            // highlight-end
     requireClientAuth: true
```

The `issuerRef` property contains the following variables:

| Variable | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `issuer_name` | The name of the issuer or cluster issuer. |
| `issuer` | A Kubernetes resource that represents a certificate authority. The value of this property can be `Issuer` or `ClusterIssuer`. If the `kind` property is not set, or if it is set to `Issuer`, an issuer with the name specified in the `name` property that exists in the same namespace as the certificate is used. |

### Provide a certificate

You can provide a certificate as a secret by adding the `nodeSecretRef` property to the cluster specification file that you created. For information about Secrets, see the Kubernetes [Secrets](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/) documentation. The cert-manager [Certificate](https://cert-manager.io/docs/concepts/certificate/) documentation contains detailed information about certificates, including a diagram of the certificate lifecycle.

You can provide a certificate for `kafkaAPI` or `schemaRegistry` in the same way. The following example is the `kafkaAPI` configuration with the `nodeSecretRef` property highlighted:

```yaml
kafkaApi:
 - port: 9092
   tls:
     enabled: true
          // highlight-start
     nodeSecretRef: 
       name: <secret_name>
       namespace: <secret_namespace>
            // highlight-end
     requireClientAuth: true
```

The `nodeSecretRef` property contains the following variables: 

| Variable | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `secret_name` | Name of the certificate secret. |
| `secret_namespace` | Kubernetes namespace where the certificate secret is. If the secret is in a different namespace than the Redpanda cluster, the operator copies it to the namespace of the Redpanda cluster. |

## Step 4: Create the Redpanda cluster 

After you configure the cluster specification file, you must run the `kubectl apply` command to create the cluster. You can run the command using a path to the cluster specification file on your local machine, or you can use the URL to the `mtls.yaml` file.

If you modified the file in the previous step, you have the file saved locally. To create the Redpanda cluster, run:

```bash
kubectl apply -f <cluster_specification.yaml>
```

If you did not modify the example file, you can use the URL to the example file in GitHub to create the cluster: 

```bash
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/redpanda-data/redpanda-examples/main/docs/example-config/kubernetes/mtls.yaml
```

## Step 5: Create the ConfigMap

Create a YAML file to hold the configuration for mTLS, including the location of the public certificate. In the next step, you create the Pod, which consumes this ConfigMap. This lets you run `rpk` commands with mTLS authentication.

For detailed information, see the Kubernetes [ConfigMaps](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/configmap/) documentation.

1. Copy the text below and save it locally as a YAML file, such as `mtls_config_map.yaml`.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: <ConfigMap_name>
data:
  redpanda.yaml: |
    redpanda:
    rpk:
      kafka_api:
        brokers: 
          - <cluster_name>-0.<cluster_name>.default.svc.cluster.local:9092
        tls:
          key_file: <key_file_path>/tls.key
          cert_file: <cert_file_path>/tls.crt 
          truststore_file: <truststore_file_path>/ca.crt
```

2. In the file you just saved, configure these variables:

    | Variable | Description |
    | --- | --- |
    | `ConfigMap_name` | Name of the ConfigMap. This can be any string. This is what you use to reference the ConfigMap in the next step when you configure the Pod. |
    | `cluster_name` | Name of the Redpanda cluster you defined in the cluster specification file. |
    | `key_file_path` | Directory where you want to mount the `tls.key` private client key. Generally this is `/etc/tls/certs`. |
    | `cert_file_path` | Filename and directory where you want to mount the `tls.crt` private key. Generally this is `/etc/tls/certs`.  |
    | `truststore_file_path` | Directory where you want to mount the `ca.crt` file. Generally this is `/etc/tls/certs/ca`.  |
3. Save the file. 

### External connectivity

If you're configuring mTLS with external connectivity, you must configure the brokers accordingly. Replace the `brokers` property in the example file with this:

```yaml
brokers: 
 - 0.<subdomain_name>.:<node_port>
```

Configure the following variables in the `brokers` property: 

| Variable | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `subdomain_name` | Name of the subdomain that you include in the cluster specification file in **Step 1**. |
| `node_port` | Kafka API external port. Unless you include this in the cluster specification file, this port is autogenerated by Kubernetes. |

## Step 6: Configure the Pod

The Pod is the process that consumes the ConfigMap you created. This Pod runs the Redpanda image for running `rpk`, which is part of the Redpanda image.

For detailed information about Pods, see the Kubernetes [Pods](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/) documentation.

1. Copy the text below and save it locally as a YAML file, such as `mtls_pod.yaml`.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: <pod_name>
spec:
  containers:
    - name: rpk
      image: 'vectorized/redpanda:<redpanda-version>'
      command:
        - /bin/bash
        - '-c'
      args:
        - sleep infinity
      volumeMounts:
        - mountPath: <key_file_path>
          name: <tls_volume_name>
        - mountPath: <truststore_file_path>
          name: <ca_volume_name>
        - mountPath: /etc/redpanda
          name: <rpk_volume_name>
  restartPolicy: Never
  volumes:
    - name: <tls_volume_name>
      secret:
        secretName: <cluster_name>-user-client
    - name: <ca_volume_name>
      secret:
        secretName: <cluster_name>-redpanda
    - name: <rpk_volume_name>
      configMap:
        name: <configMap_name>
```

2. In the file you just saved, configure these variables:

  | Variable | Description |
  | --- | --- |
  | `pod_name` | Name of the Pod. This is the Pod that runs `rpk`. This can be any string. |
  | `args` | Specifies what you want the Pod to do. You can run `rpk` commands here. This example uses the `sleep infinity` argument, which tells the Pod to keep running so that you can run as many `rpk` commands as you want from the command line. |
3. Configure the `volumeMounts` properties. There are three: one for `tls`, one for `ca`, and one for `rpk`.
    * `tls` - The path and the name of the `tls.crt` and `tls.key` volume mount. 

      | Variable | Description |
      | --- | --- |
      | `key_file_path` | The same path that you specified in the `key_file_path` and `cert_file_path` properties in the ConfigMap. Generally this is `/etc/tls/certs`.  |
      | `tls_volume_name` | Must match the `tls_volume_name` in the `volumeMounts` property.  |
    * `ca` - The path and the name of the `ca.crt` volume mount. 

      | Variable | Description |
      | --- | --- |
      | `truststore_file_path` | The same path that you specified in the `truststore_file_path` property in the ConfigMap. Generally this is `/etc/tls/certs/ca`.  |
      | `ca_volume_name` | This can be any string, but it must match the `ca_volume_name` in the `volumes` property of this file. |
    * `rpk` - The path and the name of the `rpk` volume mount.

      | Variable | Description |
      | --- | --- |
      | `name` | This can be any string, but it must match the `rpk_volume_name` in the `volumes` property of this file.  |
4. Configure the `volumes` properties. There are three: one for `tls`, one for `ca`, and one for `rpk`.
    * `tls` -  The name and secret of the `tls.crt` and `tls.key` volume mount.

      | Variable | Description |
      | --- | --- |
      | `tls_volume_name` | This must be the same as the `tls_volume_name` in the `volumeMounts` property of this file. |
      | `cluster_name` | Cluster name that you defined in the cluster specification file in **Step 1**. The `secretName` property specifies the name of the client secret. For the Kafka API, this is `<cluster_name>-user-client`.  |

    * `ca` - The name and secret of the `ca.crt` volume mount.

      | Variable | Description |
      | --- | --- |
      | `name` | This must be the same as the `ca_volume_name` in the `volumeMounts` property.  |
      | `cluster_name` | Cluster name that you defined in the cluster specification file in **Step 1**. The `secretName` property specifies the name of the node secret. For the Kafka API, this is `<cluster_name>-redpanda`.  |
    * `rpk` - The volume name and ConfigMap name of the `rpk` volume mount.

      | Variable | Description |
      | --- | --- |
      | `rpk_volume_name` | This must match the `<rpk_volume_name>` in the `volumeMounts` property of this file. |
      | `configMap_name` | ConfigMap name you specified in the `name` property of the ConfigMap in the previous step.  |
5. Configure the `<redpanda-version>` variable. Add a Redpanda version, such as `v21.11.11`. You can find all Redpanda version tags in the [Redpanda Docker Hub repository](https://hub.docker.com/r/redpandadata/redpanda/tags?page=1&ordering=last_updated).
6. Save the file. 

## Step 7: Create the Pod

To create the pod, run:

```bash
kubectl apply -f <mtls_pod.yaml>
```

## Step 8: Connect to Redpanda

Now that you have mTLS enabled and the Pod created, you can start using `rpk` to interact with Redpanda. Note that each time you run an `rpk` command, `rpk` establishes a connection and authenticates the server and the server authenticates the client.

1. Create a topic with this command: 

```bash
kubectl exec <pod_name> -- rpk topic create <topic_name> 
```

Configure these variables:

| Variable | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `pod_name` | Name of the Pod that you specified in the Pod configuration file. |
| `topic_name` | Name of the topic that you're creating with this command. |

2. To describe the topic, run:

```bash
kubectl exec <pod_name> -- rpk topic describe <topic_name> 
```

:::note
You don't need to specify the brokers in these commands, because they were defined in the ConfigMap. If you include brokers in the `rpk` commands, it overrides the brokers in the ConfigMap.
:::

## Step 9: Clean up

You can use [rpk commands](../../rpk/rpk-topic) to start producing and consuming to your cluster.

When you're ready to delete your cluster and configuration files, run:

```bash
kubectl delete -f <cluster_specification.yaml> -f <mtls_config_map.yaml> -f <mtls_pod.yaml>
```
