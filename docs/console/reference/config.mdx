## Configuration sources

Console loads configuration properties from three sources - in that order:
- Command line arguments (flags)
- YAML config
- Environment variables
Accordingly, environment variables and YAML configs can overwrite input that is set using flags.

### YAML configuration

The recommended configuration source is a YAML file. Specify the path to the file by either setting
the flag `-config.filepath` or by providing the path using the environment variable `CONFIG_FILEPATH`.
A reference YAML configuration file is provided under [Sample configuration](#sample-configuration).

### Environment variables

Configuration options can be configured using environment variables as well. The key for the environment
variable is auto generated by upper casing the YAML equivalent and adding an underscore for each 
indentation level. For example:

- kafka.rackId => KAFKA_RACKID
- kafka.tls.caFilepath => KAFKA_TLS_CAFILEPATH

You can provide configuration properties that expect a list of values using a comma-separated string:

- KAFKA_BROKERS=redpanda-0:9092,redpanda-1:9092,redpanda-2:9092

:::warning
You cannot use environment variables to configure object arrays, such as the configuration
for Kafka connect clusters. The recommended configuration source is a YAML file, whose secrets can be
provided using environment variables or command line arguments.
:::

## Sample configuration

The following `config.yaml` configuration file includes a complete list of all Console config properties and their descriptions.
All shown values reflect the default values. Provide the filepath to your configuration file by setting either the flag
`-config.filepath` or the environment variable `CONFIG_FILEPATH`.

:::note
This config file contains both enterprise and community configurations. If you don't provide an enterprise license, 
Console ignores configurations for enterprise features.
